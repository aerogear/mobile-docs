= Mobile Docs

Our goal is to help users of AeroGear projects "understand things well and not feel like they're dealing with a capricious minor god instead of a product." footnote:[Laura Bailey]

This readme introduces the standards for AeroGear docs.

:toc: 1

== Concepts, Procedures and Reference

Concept::
An introduction to a new term, process, module or component. For example, "Mobile Service" : what is it? why do I care? and how does it fit into my development environment?

Procedure::
The important information that gets me using AeroGear software, for example, write your procedure by answering the following questions:
+
. Who should perform this procedure?
. Why am I performing this procedure? benefits or context in a higher level user story
. What is the object of the task? eg adding a dashboard.. to what?
. What do I need to know and/or do before installing or provisioning the software?
. What do I need to do to provision the software?
. What are the minimum configuration tasks that I need to do to get value from the software?
. What additional information would be useful after completing procedure (eg, next steps)

Reference::
Information I might need to debug or extend the normal usage of AeroGear software. For example:
+
* API syntax and definitions
* Configuration optionss 


== Writing AeroGear Documentation

. Contact the docs team to plan your work. For example, make a PR against this repo.
. Break the writing task down into components, how many procedures do you need to write? can the reference material be generated from code? Is it reasonable to expect users to understand the commponents, or should there be an introduction to the concepts?
. Determine which functionality is this documentation related to?
+
* Push
* Sync
* Common to all mobile services
. Stick to present tense, eg `When you add the dashboard, it appears on ...`, not `When you add the dashboard, it will appear on ...`

With this information, you should be able to make a PR against the appropriate repo. 

== Asciidoc

For a fuller list of asciidoc syntax, see link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[the quick reference], note the following syntax to avoid:

* Headings using --, ~~, ^^, ++ syntax
* Markdown
* Source block without syntax. Try to use syntax highlighting where possible, for example `[source, bash]`

[NOTE]
--
This page acts as example of documentation best practises:

* introducing terms
* a single  procedure
* reference material
