= Mobile Docs

Our goal is to help users of AeroGear projects "understand things well and not feel like they're dealing with a capricious minor god instead of a product." footnote:[Laura Bailey]

This readme introduces the standards for AeroGear docs.

:toc: 1

== Concepts, Procedures and Reference

Concept::
An introduction to a new term, process, module or component. For example, "Mobile Service" : what is it? why do I care? and how does it fit into my development environment?

* Name file by slugifying title

* Prefix filenames with con_

Procedure::
The important information that gets me using AeroGear software, for example, write your procedure by answering the following questions:
+
. Who should perform this procedure?
. Why am I performing this procedure? benefits or context in a higher level user story
. What is the object of the task? eg adding a dashboard.. to what?
. What do I need to know and/or do before installing or provisioning the software?
. What do I need to do to provision the software?
. What are the minimum configuration tasks that I need to do to get value from the software?
. What additional information would be useful after completing procedure (eg, next steps)

* Name file by slugifying title

* no prefix on filenames

Reference::
Information I might need to debug or extend the normal usage of AeroGear software. For example:
+
* API syntax and definitions
* Configuration optionss 

* Name file by slugifying title

* Prefix filenames with ref_


== Writing AeroGear Documentation

. If you make a filename change (eg adding or renaming a file), you must update the appropriate modules/ROOT/nav.adoc file. 
. Test your changes xref:#using-antora[using Antora]
. Determine which functionality is this documentation related to?
+
* Push
* Metrics
* Common to all mobile services
* Common to all services or SDKs but with some information that is specific to each.
+
With this information, you should be able to determine where the file should be located in the repo, eg modules/ROOT/push
+
If you intend to reuse a part of a file, create a partial in modules/ROOT/_partials and refer to it using an `include`


. Stick to present tense, eg `When you add the dashboard, it appears on ...`, not `When you add the dashboard, it will appear on ...`


== Asciidoc

For a fuller list of asciidoc syntax, see link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[the quick reference], note the following syntax to avoid:

* Headings using --, ~~, ^^, ++ syntax
* Markdown
* Source block without syntax. Try to use syntax highlighting where possible, for example `[source, bash]`

[NOTE]
--
This page acts as example of documentation best practises:

* introducing terms
* a single  procedure
* reference material

== Using Antora to convert asciidoc to html

After modifying documentation, you can validate your changes and preview the results by:

. Install Antora globally as described in their https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/install-antora/[install guide].
+
NOTE: As part of Antora installation, you should install site-generator globally.
+
If you encounter a libcurl error on linux, follow the Option 1 instructions at:
https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/troubleshoot-nodegit/


. Fork this repo and set up origin and upstream remotes.

. Change to the `mobile-docs` directory.

. Run antora:
+
----
./bin/build.sh local-site.yml
----
+ 
After building for the first time, you can run the following command for subsequent builds:
+
----
./bin/quick-build.sh <site-file>.yml
----
+
Note: <site-file> refers to either:
+
* local-site - your current directory
* site.yml - the master branch of the github repo


NOTE: After changes to link:https://github.com/aerogear/antora-ui[antora-ui], you might need to run 'antora --pull --clean <site-file>' to pick up those changes.

== Remote Repos

No remote repos were harmed in the production of this documentation ;)

However, references to code maybe be included as follows:


1. Decide on a name for the snippet, eg push-ios-register 

2. Create a partial in mobile-docs, eg
https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-docs/blob/master/modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/push-ios-register.inc

3. Reference the code file you want to use (with a tags filter):
+
----
 include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/ios-showcase-template/push-push/ios-showcase-template/push/PushHelper.swift[tags=push-ios-register]
----

4. Add tags to the code repo, eg 
+
----
// tag::push-ios-register[]
    public func registerUPS(_ deviceToken: Data) {
        AgsCore.logger.info("Registered for notifications with token")

        var config = UnifiedPushConfig()
        config.alias = "Example App"
        config.categories = ["iOS", "Example"]

        AgsPush.instance.register(
            deviceToken,
            config,
            success: {
                AgsCore.logger.info("Successfully registered to Unified Push Server")
            },
            failure: { (error: Error!) in
                AgsCore.logger.error("Failure to register for on Unified Push Server: \(error)")
            }
        )
    }
// end::push-ios-register[]

----

5. Edit adoc file with the following to display the content:
+
----
 include::{partialsdir}/push-ios-register.inc-rantora.adoc[]
----
+
NOTE: You need to run mobile-docs:/bin/build.sh <site>.yml to make sure the temp files are in place when building site
