== Creating an iOS application

To start, get this link:https://github.com/jboss-mobile/unified-push-helloworld/tree/master/ios-swift[HelloWorld Application]. It uses our SDK to register your application installation with the iOS Variant you registered earlier!

[source,c]
----
git clone git@github.com:jboss-mobile/unified-push-helloworld.git
cd ios-swift
----

=== HelloWorld App

To open the project, invoke:

[source,c]
----
open HelloWorldSwift.xcodeproj
----

Once the project is opened in Xcode, you need to change the *Bundle ID*, since it *has* to match the one that you created earlier:

=== Setting up the iOS Variant ID

Now it is time to look at the code: Open the link:https://github.com/jboss-mobile/unified-push-helloworld/blob/master/ios-swift/HelloWorldSwift/AppDelegate.swift[AppDelegate file]. 

Here we have removed all the unneeded boilerplate code, in order to focus on getting the _Apple Push Notifications_ to work. The _application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_ method contains a call to the _registerForRemoteNotificationTypes_ to notify the operating system, that this app is interested in different types of _Remote Notifications_:


[source,c]
----
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
  // bootstrap the registration process by asking the user to 'Accept' and then register with APNS thereafter
  let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: nil)
  UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
  UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()
...
  return true
}
----

__Note iO7:__ Instead of iOS8 specific _registerUserNotificationSettings_ use _registerForRemoteNotificationTypes_. If you want to offer support for both iOS7 and iOS8 in ObjC syntax see this link:https://www.hackingwithswift.com/new-syntax-swift-2-availability-checking[code], for a Swift2 check use link:https://www.hackingwithswift.com/new-syntax-swift-2-availability-checking[#available check].

Once the application is started the _FIRST_ time, it generates the following dialog, where the user has to agree that the application _may_ receive "Push Notification Messages":


image:./img/PushDialog.png[iOS Push Dialoag]

Once the user agrees, Push Messages can be received by the app!


After making sure the user is asked to agree on receiving Push Messages, we need to implement the _application: didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:_ from the _UIApplicationDelegate_ protocol. This is callback is _ALWAYS_ invoked when the user is allowing _Push Notifications_. It basically delegates the _DeviceToken_, that your device and the _Apple Push Network Service_ negotiated, to _AeroGear Push Server_ so that it can store it in a "Database" and use it to send messages to it. The _deviceToken_ basically identifies THIS phone with _APNs_.


_Note: Mostly the token stays the same, but there are cases when it may change..._


Now let's look at the important code section:

[source,c]
----
func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
  // time to register user with the "AeroGear UnifiedPush Server"

  let device = AGDeviceRegistration(config: "pushconfig")  // [1]
  // perform registration of this device
  device.registerWithClientInfo({ (clientInfo: AGClientDeviceInformation!) in // [2]
    // set the deviceToken
    clientInfo.deviceToken = deviceToken
            
    // --optional config--
    // set some 'useful' hardware information params
    let currentDevice = UIDevice()
           
    clientInfo.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName // [3]
    clientInfo.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion    // [4]
    clientInfo.deviceType = currentDevice.model           // [5]
  },
  success: {
    // successfully registered!
    print("successfully registered with UPS!")
                
    // send NSNotification for success_registered, will be handle by registered AGViewController
    let notification = NSNotification(name:"success_registered", object: nil)
    NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotification(notification)
    },
            
  failure: {(error: NSError!) in
    print("Error Registering with UPS: \(error.localizedDescription)")
           
    let notification = NSNotification(name:"error_register", object: nil)
     NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotification(notification)
  })
}
    
----

In [1] we initialize our _AGDeviceRegistration_ object reading fhconfig.plist file. See below the content of the config file:

[source,c]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>serverURL</key>
    <string>http://192.168.0.10:8080/ag-push</string>
    <key>variantID</key>
    <string>a62785ec-2f08-408d-93f3-c4869e0edbfe</string>
    <key>variantSecret</key>
    <string>7ba81aed-f561-4476-8ecf-45d506800dca</string>
</dict>
</plist>
----

In this file we define the _serverURL_ if the Unified Push Server,the _VariantID_  and _VariantSecret_ (which we received it in the previous chapter when we were registering the _iOS Variant_ with the _Push Application_).

**NOTE:** You can not use _localhost_ from the device, you have to use an (internal) IP address, where the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ is running!

[NOTE]
Do not forget to use the _development_ _VariantID_ and _VariantSecret_ if you are using your _development_ provisioning profile as your signing identity in Xcode, or to use _production_ _VariantID_ and _VariantSecret_ if you are using your _distribution_ provisioning profile.)

Next, in [2] we call _registerWithClientInfo_ passing a configuration block that sets up the parameters needed to register this app with the _AeroGear Push Server_: the Device Token. It is valid to specify a bit more data on the _clientInfo_ and we do here by setting metadata such the operating system [3], its version [4] and the device type [5].

==== Callbacks

The _success_ callback is invoked, when the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ was able to register your device with the given _iOS Variant_. Otherwise the _failure_ callback would be invoked. One case could be a wrong IP address....


The _application: didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:_ would be invoked if there is a problem in receving a token from _APNs_...

=== Metrics 
Optionally the iOS SDK supports sending metrics to UPS. Metrics can be used to view how many users have used the message to open the app. This can be important information if you want to know how well your messages are received by your application users.

UPS sends an unique ID for every push message by default all we have to do is send this ID back to UPS when the app was opened using the message:

[source,c]
----
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
       
  // bootstrap the registration process by asking the user to 'Accept' and then register with APNS thereafter
  let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: nil)
  UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
  UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()
        
  // Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
  AGPushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppLaunched(launchOptions)
  ...
  return true
}
----

If the application is launched using a push notification the _sendMetricsWhenAppLaunched_ static function needs to be invoked within the _didFinishLaunchingWithOptions_ method. 

When the app is brought from background to foreground due to a push notification, the following line needs to be added to the _didReceiveRemoteNotification_ method:

[source,c]
----
func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject: AnyObject], fetchCompletionHandler: (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
  // When a message is received, send NSNotification, would be handled by registered ViewController
  let notification:NSNotification = NSNotification(name:"message_received", object:nil, userInfo:userInfo)
  NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotification(notification)
  print("UPS message received: \(userInfo)")
        
  // Send metrics when app is brpught form backgrpund tp foreground due to push notification
  AGPushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppAwoken(application.applicationState, userInfo: userInfo)
        
   // No additioanl data to fetch
   fetchCompletionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResult.NoData)
}
----

=== Test the app on your device

Now run the phone on the device. After agreeing on receiving Push Messages, you will see another Dialog, that welcomes you! Now put the app into the background, by clicking the home button.


=== Sending messages to the device

The last chapter shows how to link:#send-push[send messages] to the device, using the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_!
