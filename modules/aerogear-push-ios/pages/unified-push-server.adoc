== The UnifiedPush Server

With all the Apple work being done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to APNs for a later message sending.

:pushplatform: iOS
In the link:/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#_the_wizard[Wizard] after you create a PushApplication, click the **Add Variant** button and fill out the iOS option. You will want to use the certificate, that you created earlier:

Afterwards you will see some code snippets, containing the **Variant ID** and **Secret**, that you can use in your Windows application for the registration of the device, running your app:

NOTE: Clicking on the appropriate tab, you can choose between _Objective-C_, _Swift_ and _Cordova_ snippet!

=== Xcode

The server is now configured. Let's move to Xcode to create a very simple link:#ios-app[example application] that will connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
