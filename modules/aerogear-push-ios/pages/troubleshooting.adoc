Something goes wrong, you have the symptoms and you would like to know how to fix it.  Follow the guide of frequently asked questions below and if you still can't find an answer to your problem, don't hesitate to ask our link:http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com/[mailing list].

### Question: No matching provisioning profiles found

*Problem description*

Running a client app, you run into "No matching provisioning profiles found":

image:./img/no_matching_provisionning_profile.png[No matching provisioning profile]


*Answer*

* have you changed your computer recently? If yes, if you provisioning profile was deliver in your previous machine, you need to migrate your provisioning profile, please follow link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-accounts_preferences/articles/export_signing_assets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013306-CH8-SW1[Exporting Your Signing Identities and Provisioning Profiles] Apple documentation.
* is it the first time you use this app? have you followed the pre-requisite section on link:#provisioning-profiles[provisioning profile]?

### Question: Remote host closed connection during handshake

*Problem description*

When sending a push notification you are receicing an 'Remote host closed connection during handshake'
[source,java]
----
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake
----

*Answer*

Your .p12 is not good. You need to create a .p12 out of your certificate as described in link:#_apple_app_id_and_ssl_certificate_for_apns[Apple App ID and SSL certificate for APNs]?

### Question: APNs error

*Problem description*

You have implemented application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:. When launching the app, you get the eror no valid 'aps-environment':
[source,c]
----
Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3000 "no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application" UserInfo=0x1555edc0 {NSLocalizedDescription=no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application}
----

*Answer*

Your Bundle ID name should match with the Bundle ID as created on Apple's developer portal. Please refer to [Apple App ID and SSL certificate for APNs](app-id-sll-certificate-apns.asciidoc) documentation for more details on configuration.

#### Question: My registration to UPS never happens

*Problem description*

The success callback application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: is never called.

*Answer*

* implement application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError: to track any issue with APN registration. In the body of the method, print an error message as shown below:
[source,c]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
    // something went wrong, while talking to APNs
    // for now we simply log the error
    NSLog(@"APNs Error: %@", error);
}
----
If you do enter the failure callback then your problem is similar to link:#_question_apns_error[APNs error]

* If you do not enter the error callback, check you actually _did_ register for remote notifications. Note: with iOS8, your remote registration to APNs is splitted into 2 methods call. See code snippet in link:#_question_compilation_error_in_xcode6[Compilation error in Xcode6]

### Question: My registration fails because of nil deviceID

*Problem description*

UPS registration fails with the following error:

[source,c]
----
assertion failed: 'token' should be set: file /.../aerogear-push-ios-registration/push-sdk-swift/AGDeviceRegistration.swift, line 75
----

*Answer*

In application like link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-quickstarts/tree/master/client/contacts-mobile-ios-client[Contacts app] where UPS registration does not happen in AppDelegate but later in the flow, at Login, we save deviceID in NSUserDefaults within application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken. However, if the method application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: is not called, deviceID is nil causing UPS registration to fail.

To solve the problem, refer to link:#_question_my_registration_to_ups_never_happens[My registration to UPS never happens]

### Question: Compilation error in Xcode6

*Problem description*

When trying to run my Xcode5 app in Xcode6, I run into compilation error.

*Answer*

Since iO8, registerForRemoteNotificationTypes has been deprecated in favour of registerUserNotificationSettings: with registerForRemoteNotifications. The API unifies notification settings whether it's a remote or user notification. If you want to be able to run either using Xcode5 or Xcode6 on iOS7 or iOS8, use the macro as shown below:

[source,c]
----
#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000
    if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {
        UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound categories:nil];
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
    } else {
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
    }

#else
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
#endif

### Question: Failure to connect when server uses a self-signed certificate

*Problem description*

When trying to connect  to a server that uses a self-signed certificate, the application fails to connect with the following message:

[source,c]
----
Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1202 "The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “example.com” which could put your confidential information at risk." UserInfo=0x14a730 {NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=https://example.com/, NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestion=Would you like to connect to the server anyway?, ..}
----

*Answer*

By default, the underlying networking foundation rejects connections to server's that use a self-signed certificate and you need to take extra measures in order to make it work. Although the following snippets of code can bypass the built-in security check, they are *not recommended unless you are working in a development sandbox and you need a quick-and-dirty solution for internal testing*. You can find more information on self-signed certificates on link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2232/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40012884-CH1-SECSELFSIGNEDCERTS[Apple technote paper] as well in link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push/pull/46#issuecomment-75815787[this page here] that summarizes possible solutions when you take your app in production.

*Objective-C*

If you are using Objective-C, modify the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push/blob/1.x_dev/push-sdk/AGDeviceRegistration.m[AGDeviceRegistration.m] source code and add the following function:

[source,c]

- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session didReceiveChallenge:(NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *)challenge completionHandler:(void (^)(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition, NSURLCredential *))completionHandler {    
    if([challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod isEqualToString:NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust] && [challenge.protectionSpace.host isEqualToString:_baseURL.host]) {
        NSURLCredential *credential = [NSURLCredential credentialForTrust:challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust];
        completionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeUseCredential,credential);
    } else {
        completionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeCancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil);
    }
}

*Swift*

If you are using Swift modify the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push/blob/master/push-sdk-swift/AGDeviceRegistration.swift[AGDeviceRegistration.swift] source code and add the following function:

[source,c]

public func URLSession(session: NSURLSession, task: NSURLSessionTask, didReceiveChallenge challenge: NSURLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: (NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition, NSURLCredential!) -> Void) {
    if challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust && challenge.protectionSpace.host == serverURL.host! {
        let credentials = NSURLCredential(forTrust: challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust!)
        completionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition.UseCredential, credentials)
    } else {
        completionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition.CancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil)
    }
}
