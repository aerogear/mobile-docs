= Enabling file uploads

{sync-server} provides support for uploading binary data along with the GraphQL queries.
The implementation relies on upstream `Apollo Server` capabilities.

The upload functionality uses the GraphQL multipart form requests specification.
File upload needs to be implemented on both server and client:

1. On the client HTML FileList objects are mapped into a mutation and sent to the server in a multipart request.

2. On the server: The multipart request is handled. The server processes it and provides an upload argument to a resolver.
In the resolver function, the upload promise resolves an object.

NOTE: File upload is based on link:https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec[graphql-multipart-request-spec].

.Procedure

To enable file uploads, create a schema and use the `Upload` scalar.
For example:

[source, javascript]
----
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type File {
    filename: String!
    mimetype: String!
    encoding: String!
  }
  type Query {
    uploads: [File]
  }
  type Mutation {
    singleUpload(file: Upload!): File!
  }
`;
----

The following schema enables file uploads. The `Upload` scalar will be injected as one of the arguments in the resolvers.
The `Upload` scalar contains all file metadata and a link:https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams[Readable Stream] that can be used to save the file to a specific location.

[source, javascript]
----

    async singleUpload(parent, { file }) {
      const { stream, filename, mimetype, encoding } = await file;
      // Save file and return required metadata
    }
----
