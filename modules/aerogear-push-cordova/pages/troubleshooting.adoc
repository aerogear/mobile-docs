## Android

### Issue: Registration fails with the error "SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE"

*Problem description*

Your error callback is called with the message "SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE".

*Answer*

There are several causes for this issue.  The easiest solution is that the GCM registration service had an error and you should retry at a later date.  However, there are also several code/environment issues to check.

. You do not have Google Play Services installed on your device. +
If you are running an emulator, make sure you are using a Google APIs Target higher than Android 4.2. If you are using a device, make sure you are using a Google experience device and not an Amazon Fire or AOSP device.

. Make sure your device's clock is set correctly.  Some people on link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17188982/how-to-fix-google-cloud-messaging-registration-error-service-not-available[Stack Overflow] have reported this issue.

### Issue: Registration fails with INVALID_SENDER

*Problem description*

Your error callback is called with the exception message "INVALID_SENDER".

*Answer*

Make sure the SenderID matches the project number from the Google API Console.  This will be an link:../../aerogear-push-android/img/gcc_3.png[all numeric string].

## iOS

### Issue: APNs error

*Problem description*

Your error callback is called with the message: "no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application"

*Answer*

Your Bundle ID name should match with the Bundle ID as created on Apple's developer portal. Please refer to link:../../aerogear-push-ios/guides/#app-id-ssl-certificate-apns[Apple App ID and SSL certificate for APNs] documentation for more details on configuration.
