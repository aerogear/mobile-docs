== The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server

With all the Google work being done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to FCM for later message sending.

:pushplatform: Android

In the link:/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#_the_wizard[Wizard] after you create a PushApplication, click the **Add Variant** button and fill out the Android options. You will want to use the **Server Key** and **Sender ID** obtained from the *Firebase Console* in their appropriate fields:

Afterwards you will see some code snippets, containing the **Variant ID** and **Secret**, that you can use in your Android application for the registration of the device, running your app:

NOTE: Clicking on the appropriate tab, you can choose between _Android_ and _Cordova_ snippet!

=== Android Studio

The server is now configured. Let's move to Android Studio and link:#android-app[create an Android application] that will use the AeroGear Android library to connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
