== UPS Configuration Properties

For an advanced configuration (or just plain testing purposes), it is possible to launch the UPS with a bunch of different properties - some of them can be configured via System Properties, others can be configured as a configuration of JMS subsystem and other are configured of EJB.

[[commandline]]
==== Configuring System Properties via CLI configuration arguments
It is possible to specify one or more of the above system properties, when launching the Java EE container, like:

[source,c]
----
$ ./path/to/SERVER_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -Daerogear.ios.batchSize=2000
----


[[xmlconfig]]
==== Configuring System Properties via XML configuration file
It is also possible to include the desired system variables into the +standalone-full.xml+ configuration file:

[source,xml]
----
...
</extensions>

<system-properties>
   <property name="aerogear.ios.batchSize" value="2000"/>
   ...
</system-properties>
----

=== Configuring JMS messaging subsystem

By default, JMS queues and topics required for UnifiedPush Server to work are installed via CLI script `jms-setup-wildfly.cli`.

The properties of these queues and topics can be configured to change characteristics of message delivery.

NOTE: Some queues are configured for each supported Push Network: Adm, APNs, GCM, MPNS, SimplePush, WNS. In the table it is represented as a placeholder {Network}.

[width="80%",cols="3,^2,^2",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|JMS Destination |Properties |Explanation

|`/queue/{Network}PushMessageQueue` |`redelivery-delay=1500`|when `TokenLoader` fails to load tokens (for example when the queue it pushes tokens to is full) it will retry delivery in 1.5s
|`/queue/{Network}PushMessageQueue` |`redelivery-multiplier=1.5, max-redelivery-delay=5000`| `redelivery-delay` is increased after repeated failure until it reaches 5s
|`/queue/{Network}TokenBatchQueue` |`address-full-policy=FAIL` |when the token queue is full, the `TokenLoader` will fail, and it will be redelivered according to properties of `{Network}PushMessageQueue`
|`/queue/{Network}TokenBatchQueue` |`max-size-bytes=40000` |specifies how many tokens can be stored for given {Network} (in bytes)
|`/queue/TriggerMetricCollectionQueue` |`redelivery-delay=1000` | trigger `MetricCollector` every 1 second until all metrics are collected

|=========================================================

The properties can be configured either during installation by modifying the installation CLI script or once installed, they can be changed in `<address-settings>` section of `standalone-full.xml`.

=== Configuring workers

UnifiedPush Server uses Message-Driven Beans (MDBs) as workers for processing internal JMS events.

The number of created workers can be configured by tweaking activation config property `maxSession` in `/WEB-INF/jboss-ejb3.xml` configuration file in the deployed WAR.

By default, there are 15 workers for processing each of the queues.

NOTE: The only exception is `/queue/APNsTokenBatchQueue` which has limit of 10 workers, which is given by the limit of maximum 10 connections to APNs per one certificate.

NOTE: In order to fully understand how JMS Internals work in UnifiedPush Server, see Appendix section.
