[[provisioning]]
== Provisioning your First Service

{product-name} provide commonly required features for mobile app development.

This section introduces the procedures for using {product-name} by guiding you through the process using the Identity Management service. For a full list of available services, see xref:con_services.adoc[Mobile Services]

:service-name: Identity Management

// start {partialsdir}/generic-provisioning.adoc[]

// end {partialsdir}/generic-provisioning.adoc[]

NOTE: When completing the {keycloak-service} provisioning wizard, you are prompted to enter configuration data. For the purposes of this guide, keep the default values.
For more information about the {keycloak-service} provisioning wizard fields, see xref:{keycloak-service}-configuration-additional-resources[{keycloak-service} Configuration].

=== Additional resources

==== {keycloak-service} Configuration

* *Keycloak admin username*: Username for Keycloak administration

* *Keycloak admin password*: Password for the Keycloak admin user

* *Name of the Keycloak realm*: Name of the keycloak realm. (defaults to current namespace)

NOTE: A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

* *Connect to an existing shared service*: Select if you want to use an existing service and you have the URL and credentials to use that service.

* *URL of the shared service*: Enter a value if you want to use an existing shared service.

NOTE: Use `Public` when binding a {mobile-client} to a {service-name}. When binding mobile services to each other, use `Bearer`.

The {service-name} service will now be expandable, details about the service can be viewed.

[[configuring]]
== Configuring the Service

The following section will guide you through configuring the schema of the redirect url and web origin for a client in {idm-name}.
This is required to enable OpenID authentication.
For an explanation of these terms, see link:https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html[Keycloak Documentation].

:service-name: Identity Management

=== Configuring {idm-name}

. Log into the {mobile-developer-console} and navigate to the {mobile-client} screen.

. Select the *Mobile Services* tab.

. If a binding to the {keycloak-service} service is in progress, a spinning icon is displayed to the right of the {keycloak-service} entry. Wait for the binding process to complete.

. If the _{idm-name} Realm URL_ URL is not visible, expand the Identity Management Service by clicking the > icon.

. Click on the *{idm-name} Realm URL* link to open the {idm-name} Administration Console.
+
// TODO: @wei will default credentials always be as follows?
. Log in to the Administration console using the credentials you specified when xref:provisioning[Provisioning] the service (defaults to admin/admin).

. Select *Clients* from the left navigation menu.
+
// TODO: with a cordova app, I didn't see mobile development platform
. Select your client from the list of clients. The name of your client is derived from the name of the {mobile-client}, the name of the mobile development platform and the client type, for example `myapp-android-public`.


. Add an additional entry to *Valid Redirect URIs*.
