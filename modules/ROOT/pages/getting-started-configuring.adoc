== Provisioning your First Service

{product-name} provide commonly required features for mobile app development.

This section introduces the procedures for using {product-name} by guiding you through the process using the Identity Management service. For a full list of available services, see xref:con_services.adoc[Mobile Services]

:service-name: Identity Management

// start {partialsdir}/generic-provisioning.adoc[]
include::_partials/generic-provisioning.adoc[]
// end {partialsdir}/generic-provisioning.adoc[]

NOTE: When completing the {keycloak-service} provisioning wizard, you are prompted to enter configuration data. For the purposes of this guide, keep the default values.
For more information about the {keycloak-service} provisioning wizard fields, see xref:{keycloak-service}-configuration-additional-resources[{keycloak-service} Configuration].

=== Additional resources

==== {keycloak-service} Configuration

* *Keycloak admin username*: Username for Keycloak administration

* *Keycloak admin password*: Password for the Keycloak admin user

* *Name of the Keycloak realm*: Name of the keycloak realm. (defaults to current namespace)

NOTE: A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

* *Connect to an existing shared service*: Select if you want to use an existing service and you have the URL and credentials to use that service.

* *URL of the shared service*: Enter a value if you want to use an existing shared service.

NOTE: Use `Public` when binding a {mobile-client} to a {service-name}. When binding mobile services to each other, use `Bearer`.

The {service-name} service will now be expandable, details about the service can be viewed.

== Configuring the Service

The following section will guide you through configuring the schema of the redirect url and web origin for a client in {idm-name}.
This is required to enable OpenID authentication.
For an explanation of these terms, see link:https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html[Keycloak Documentation].

:service-name: Identity Management

[[choose-schema]]
=== Choose the schema of a redirect url


[tabs]
====
Android::
+
--
It is recommended to use the package name of the Android app as the schema of the redirect url to avoid conflicts. (e.g. `com.aerogear.androidshowcase`)
--
iOS::
+
--
It is recommended to use the Bundle Identifier of the iOS app as the schema of the redirect url. (e.g. `org.aerogear.ios-showcase-template`)
--
Cordova::
+
--
Redirect url is `\http://localhost/\*`, without `:/callback`. Web Origin is `\http://localhost/*`.
--
Xamarin::
+
--
Depending on the platform, set the redirect as described in either the Android or the iOS tab.

=== Configuring {idm-name}

. Log into the OpenShift console and navigate to the Project Overview.

. Navigate to the {mobile-client} screen.

. Select the Mobile Services tab.

. If a binding to the {keycloak-service} service is in progress, a spinning icon is displayed to the right of the {keycloak-service} entry. Wait for the binding process to complete.

. If the _Keycloak Realm URL_ URL is not visible, expand the Identity Management Service by clicking the > icon.

. Click on the *Keycloak Realm URL* link to open the Keycloak Administration Console.

. Log in to the Administration console using the credentials you specified when xref:#provisioning[Provisioning] the service (defaults to admin:admin).

. Select `Clients` from the left navigation menu.

. Select your client from the list of clients. The name of your client is derived from the name of the {mobile-client}, the name of the mobile development platform and the client type, for example `myapp-android-public`.

. Add `<schema>:/callback` as an additional entry to `Valid Redirect URIs`. See xref:choose-schema[] to determine the value for `<schema>`.

. Add `<schema>` as an additional entry to `Web Origins`.  See xref:choose-schema[] to determine the value for `<schema>`.

. Save your changes.

. Create a new user account as described in link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/users/create-user.html[Creating a New User].

. Set up credentials for the new user as described in link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/users/credentials.html[User Credentials].
