// change to {device-security} maybe
= {device-security-service}
//tag::device-security-service[]

The {device-security-service} service allows you to easily configure and manage device security, and trust checks for your mobile application

* Perform a range of device trust checks on the mobile device, such as checking if the device is rooted, and allows you take proactive action based on the results
* Distribute SSL certificates with a mobile app to create a direct chain of trust (certificate pinning)

= {sync-service}
//tag::sync-service[]

The goal of {sync-service} is to make it easier for developers to build secure, production ready, real time APIs and applications with link:https://graphql.org/learn[GraphQL].

{sync-service} is a JavaScript framework that developers can use to add real time synchronization and enhanced offline capabilities to their mobile applications. {sync-service} includes two components - {sync-server} and {sync-client}.

{sync-server} is set of Node.js libraries that can be used to build a custom backend {sync-service} service using GraphQL.

{sync-client} is client side JavaScript library for building web and mobile applications backed by {sync-server}.

{sync-server} and {sync-client} are based off the popular link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/[Apollo] framework and add additional components to solve common problems.

* Real Time Synchronisation
* Conflict Resolution
* Robust offline experience
* Authentication and Authorization (using the {keycloak-service} service)
* Metrics (using the AeroGear {metrics-service} Service)
* Audit Logging
