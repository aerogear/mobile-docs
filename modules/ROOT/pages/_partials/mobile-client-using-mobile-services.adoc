= Using mobile services

== Viewing mobile services

In order to use services with a mobile app, the {mobile-client} associated with the app must be bound to services. 
To show the list of services, go to the application *Overview* screen and to the *Mobile Services* tab. 
There is a list of services available to be bound to the {mobile-client} and list of services that have already been bound to the client.

== Binding mobile services

The *Mobile Services* tab in the {mobile-client} view shows the provisioned services that are available to be bound
to the {mobile-client}. If a service has not yet been bound to a {mobile-client}, a binding can be created by clicking
the *Create Binding* button.

You can bind a service by clicking *Bind to App* (image is the example of a Push Service).

At the second step you can fill in configuration details for the binding (image is the example of a Push Service).

*Note:* You can safely close the dialog, everything is processed in the background.

After the binding is complete, the configuration in `mobile-services.json` for the {mobile-client} is updated in the
*Configuration* tab. This configuration is used by your app to interact with the bound services.

=== Multiple service bindings

It's most usual to have only one binding per service in the application but in some cases it's possible to create multiple bindings. 
There will be *Bind to App* button on the already bound service. The process for binding is the same.
