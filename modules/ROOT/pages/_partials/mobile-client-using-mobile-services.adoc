= Using mobile services

== Viewing mobile services

In order to use services with a mobile app, the {mobile-client} associated with the app must be bound to the appropriate services.
To show the list of services, navigate to the application *Overview* screen and to the *Mobile Services* tab.
A list of bound and available services is displayed.

NOTE: Some services might support multiple binding and in that case a *Bind to App* button is also shown in a *Bound Services* row.

== Binding mobile services

The *Mobile Services* tab in the {mobile-client} view shows the provisioned services that are available to be bound
to the {mobile-client}. If a service has not yet been bound to a {mobile-client}, a binding can be created by selecting
the *Create Binding* button.

You can bind your {mobile-client} to a service by :

. Click *Bind to App* (example image shows a Push Service binding).
+
# tag::excludeUpstream[]

# end::excludeUpstream[]

# tag::excludeDownstream[]

# end::excludeDownstream[]

. Fill in configuration details for the binding (example image shows a Push Service binding).

. Press *Create* to create the binding (example image shows a Push Service binding).
+

NOTE: You can safely close the dialog, the process continues in the background.

After the binding is complete, the JSON in the *Configuration* tab is automatically updated.
Putting this JSON into the `mobile-services.json` file for your mobile app enables your app to communicate with bound mobile services.

.Multiple service bindings

Typically, you create only one binding per service but in some cases it is possible to create multiple bindings.
In this case, a  *Bind to App* button is displayed for an already bound service.

.Multiple services unbinding

If there are multiple bindings for the service there will be more options for the deletion.
