= Registering a {mobile-client}

After provisioning Mobile Developer Console, the next step is to register a {mobile-client} for the mobile application that you are going to develop.

A {mobile-client} is a representation of the mobile application that you are developing locally. {mobile-client}s allow you to bind your mobile app to mobile services such as Identity Management, Push Notification, Mobile Metrics and others. This makes many of the common tasks associated with mobile development much easier and quicker to implement.
