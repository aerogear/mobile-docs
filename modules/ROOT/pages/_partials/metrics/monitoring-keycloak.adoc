=== Dashboard panel descriptions

The {idm-name} dashboard consists of several panels which give you an overview of the specific
events, such as the number of registered users, memory usage etc.

Below you will find a detailed description of each panel and its values.

.Singlestat Panels

Singlestat panels show you the main summary of a single data series.

* *Total Registrations*: Total number of registered (non-admin) users. This number comprises all successful registrations made via various providers, e.g. {idm-name}, Github, Facebook etc.

* *Total Logins*: Total number of successful logins (only non-admin users) over all providers.

* *Total Login Errors*: Total number of failed login attempts.

* *Current Memory*: The amount of memory currently used by the {keycloak-service} Service

.Graph panels

Used to show how certain values change over time, e.g. the number of successful logins.

* *Logins*: Overview of the successful logins over time

* *Login Errors*: Overview of the failed login attempts over time

* *Memory Usage*: The values in this graph represents the following:

** *Used*: The amount of memory currently used by the {keycloak-service} Service
** *Commited*: The amount of memory that is guaranteed to be available for use (by JVM)
** *Max*: The maximum amount of memory that can be used for memory management

.Pie Charts

Used to show the distribution of data, e.g. the number of logins per identity provider.

* *Logins Per Provider*: Overview of the successful (non-admin) user logins per provider

* *Registrations Per Provider*: Overview of the successful (non-admin) user registrations per provider.
