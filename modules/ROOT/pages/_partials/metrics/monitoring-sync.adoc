= Monitoring a {sync-server} Application

.Prerequisites

* [x] You have provisioned the xref:mobile-metrics.adoc[{metrics-service} service].
* [x] You have provisioned your xref:data-sync.adoc#sync-server-openshift[{sync-service}] service.
* [x] You have enabled metrics in {sync-server}.

NOTE: The {metrics-service} Service and your {sync-server} application must be provisioned in the same OpenShift project to access data.

== Overview

As there can be multiple {sync-server} applications in a namespace, {sync-server} application provisioning procedure creates a new Grafana dashboard for the {sync-server} application
that is being provisioned.

After the {metrics-service} Service (includes Grafana for visualization and the Prometheus monitoring system) and your {sync-server} application are provisioned,
you should be able to see the "Data Sync Metrics - <your app name>" in the list of available dashboards (navigate to Grafana's exposed URL -> Log in ->
Home -> Select *Data Sync Metrics - <your app name>*).

=== Dashboard panel descriptions

The Data Sync dashboard consists of several panels which give you an overview of the specific
events and resources, such as memory usage, CPU usage, resolved operation count etc.

The dashboard is separated into 2 section. "Client" section shows some basic metrics about the clients and users and the "Server" secion shows some metrics about the server status.

Below you will find a detailed description of each panel and its values.

.Singlestat Panels

Singlestat panels show you the main summary of a single data series.

* *CPU Usage*: CPU usage percentage of the {sync-server} application used currently.

* *Memory Usage*: The amount of memory currently used by the {sync-server} application.

.Graph panels

Used to show how certain values change over time, e.g. the number of operations resolved.

* *Unique Clients Over Time*: Overview of the number of unique clients over the selected time range. Note that a "client" is a an application installation on a device.
  The client id is reset when the application is reinstalled on the same device.

* *Unique Users Over Time*: Overview of the number of unique users over the selected time range. Note that a "user" is a user who is authenticated with the {keycloak-service}.

* *Memory Usage in Time*: The amount of memory used by the {sync-server} application over time.

* *CPU Usage in Time*: The percentage of CPU used by the {sync-server} application over time.

* *Queries/Mutations Resolved*: Overview of the resolved queries and mutations over time.

* *Resolver Timings*: Overview of the how long it took to resolve operations over time.

* *Server Response Time*: Overview of the how long it took the server to respond the requests.

* *Operations vs Conflicts*: Overview of the resolver executions and the conflicts happened.

* *Conflicts Over Time per Operation*: Overview of the conflicts and what operation caused them.
