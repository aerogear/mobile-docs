= Sharing Access to User Interfaces Associated with the {metrics-service} Service 

== Overview

The {metrics-service} Service URL is only accessible by users who have *edit* permission for the project. By default, a project owner already has permission.

The {metrics-service} Service creates routes to access Grafana and Prometheus. To protect these routes there is an OAuth reverse proxy sidecar container in front
of the Grafana and Prometheus containers to enforce authentication. The authentication is based on OpenShift permissions and is configured as part of the 
provisioning of the {metrics-service} Service. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy[documentation for the proxy container] for
more information about configuring the proxy. 

== About OAuth proxy permissions
The OAuth proxy, uses a Subject Access Review rule defined in the *deploymentConfig* resource to specify which permissions are required to access the protected
routes. This rule is defined by the `openshift-sar` option. For the Prometheus service,  the *deploymentConfig* resource in the metrics service default definition is:
//need to follow up on this, would expect this to be output of `oc deploy prometheus`
[source,yaml]
----
--openshift-sar={"namespace":"{{ namespace }}","resource":"deploymentconfigs","name":"prometheus","verb":"update"}
----

To authenticate against the OAuth proxy, a user must have  
sufficient permissions to update the *deploymentConfig* resource named `prometheus` in the current OpenShift namespace. 
The *deploymentConfig* resource for Grafana contains the same Subject Access Review rule for the `grafana` resource.


NOTE: Giving a user update permissions on a resource allows them to modify that resource object.
Access to the Prometheus and Grafana routes requires permissions to completely edit and replace the Prometheus and Grafana  *deploymentConfig* resources.

== Granting user permissions using the OpenShift web console

. In the Project, select *resources* and click on *Membership*.
. In the membership screen click on *Edit Membership*.
+
. From the *Add Another Role* list, select *edit* and click *add* to assign the role to a user.

The user can now access the Metrics routes.

== Granting user permissions using the CLI

. List all users who currently have permissions:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy who-can update dc
----
. Assign the *edit* role to a user:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user edit <user>
----
+
The user can now access the Metrics routes.

== Using the OAuth proxy to access the {metrics-service} Service

When the {metrics-service} Service is provisioned there is a route for Grafana and a route for Prometheus.
When you access one of the routes you will see the OAuth proxy landing screen.

Click *Log in with OpenShift* and log in. If you have sufficient permission to access the route
you are prompted to allow the service account access your account.

Click *Allow selected permissions*. The OAuth proxy redirects you to the requested route.
