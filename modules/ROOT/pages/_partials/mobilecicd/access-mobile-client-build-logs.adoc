= Viewing Build Logs

== Viewing Build History in the OpenShift Console

All of the builds related to your {mobile-client} can be seen in the **Builds** tab of your {mobile-client}. Each build can be expanded to show further information about the build configuration, latest build and build history.

All builds have a *View Log* link associated with them to access the detailed logs of that build.


== Viewing Build Logs in Jenkins

. Navigate to the {mobile-client} and click the *Builds* tab.

. Click the *View Log* link for the build, you are redirected to the Jenkins instance that has been running your build.

. If prompted, log into OpenShift and accept the authorization request for:
+
* user:info permission
* user:check-access permission

. View the log of the build. Based on your permissions to the OpenShift project, you might have access to other Jenkins capabilities, such as inspecting the build configuration or re-running the build with changes in the pipeline script.
