== Cache

In order to support offline use cases, the client SDK strongly leverages Apollo Cache layer.
See the link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/caching.html[Apollo cache documentation] for more information.

=== Querying Data

To work with cache effectively, {org-name} recommends using the `cache-first` fetchPolicy when performing queries.

[source, javascript]
----
  return this.apollo.watchQuery({
    query: YOUR_QUERY,
    fetchPolicy: 'cache-first',
  });
----

The cache is populated by subscriptions, pooling or regular queries happening in UI.
See the _client-offline-support, Offline Support_ section for more details.

== Required Field in GraphQL Types

A field called `id` is required in all the types when design the GraphQL schema for an application.
The client SDK expects this field to be returned from the server for a query.
Without this field some offline functionalities does not work properly.
