= Audit Logs

Audit logging is a mechanism to track all of the actions that occur inside your application. Audit Logging in {sync-server} provides two main benefits.

1. It is possible to build a detailed audit trail of every action that has occured in the application. This can also include information about the user that performed the action, and the mobile device they were using.
2. The data from the audit logs can be aggregated and visualised to provide more insight into how your application is used.

// This overview is what is called *metrics* in the rest of this document.

== Audit Logging Architecture

Audit logging can be enabled in {sync-server} using the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aerogear/voyager-audit[@aerogear/voyager-audit] module. When enabled, all actions such as GraphQL mutations, queries and subscriptions are logged in great detail to `stdout` in JSON format.

An audit log example message is shown below.

----

The `clientInfo` property of the audit log message is available only if the client is sending the client information to {sync-server}. That has to be enabled separately in the client. Additionally, data in that property can only be collected if the app is a Cordova app or a native app. Simple web clients cannot get the device, client nor app details and cannot send this information.

The `userInfo` property is available only if {sync-server} is protected by an identity manager, such as {idm-name}, and if the user is authenticated. See  see xref:sync-server-auth[].

== Enabling Audit Logging in Voyager Server

Audit logging is enabled in {sync-server} using the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aerogear/voyager-audit[@aerogear/voyager-audit]

. Import the `@aerogear/voyager-audit` module
+
[source,javascript]
----
const auditLogger = require('@aerogear/voyager-audit')
----

. Inject the auditLogger module into the {sync-server}. This enables audit logging within your application.
+
[source,javascript]
----
const voyagerConfig = {
  auditLogger
}
const server = VoyagerServer(apolloConfig, voyagerConfig)
----

The link:https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server/tree/master/examples/audit_logging[Audit Logging Example Server Guide] has an example server based off the instructions above and shows all of the steps needed to get it running.

Alternatively, if the default audit logger does not match your requirements, you can create an audit logger that implements the `AuditLogger` interface as defined below.

.Definition of the `AuditLogger` interface

[source,typescript]
----
export interface AuditLogger {
  logResolverCompletion(msg: string, success: boolean, obj: any, args: any, context: any, info: GraphQLResolveInfo): void
  logConflict (msg: string, serverData: any, clientData: any, obj: any, args: any, context: any, info: GraphQLResolveInfo): void
  auditLog(msg: string, obj: any, args: any, context: any, info: GraphQLResolveInfo): void
}
----

The following example implements an `AuditLogger` and injects it into the {sync-server}.
The example redacts the arguments using a `myCustomRedactionFunction` function.

[source,typescript]
----

const { buildPath } = require('@aerogear/voyager-tools')
// ...

const auditLogger = {
  auditLog: function(msg, obj, args, context, info){
    console.log(JSON.stringify(

== Sending Device Information in {sync-client}

See the <<#sync-js-client-audit-logs, {sync-client} Audit Logs>> section for more information.


== Exploring Audit Logs

{sync-server} simply prints audit logs to `stdout` and it is the responsibility of another component to pick up these logs and provide
functionality to the user to make use of the logs.

The *EFK stack* (ElasticSearch, Fluentd and Kibana) on OpenShift is the recommended solution in this guide. We provide Kibana dashboards with a number of useful visualisations and insights into {sync-server}.

All application logs printed to `stdout` are sent to ElasticSearch by Fluentd. However, the audit log messages printed by `@aerogear/voyager-audit` are printed in a format that is used by the Kibana dashboards.

== Configuring OpenShift Logging

OpenShift logging can be enabled as described in link:https://docs.okd.io/3.11/install_config/aggregate_logging.html[OpenShift documentation].

Once enabled, OpenShift logging will create a Fluentd instance per cluster node that reads the `stdout` and `stderr` of the pods in that node
and pushes the readings to the centralized ElasticSearch instance. Documents created in ElasticSearch instance can be then explored and
visualized by the Kibana instance, which is also installed by OpenShift logging.

OpenShift logging creates an index per namespace and that index is only available to users who have access to that namespace.
It also creates the index patterns in Kibana in the same way.

By default, OpenShift also provides a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[curator] which deletes the old
log messages from ElasticSearch to reduce storage needs and improve performance. This has an impact on audit trails and also metrics.

For long term audit trails, curator can be configured to delete messages older than your choice. If this is not sufficient,
Fluentd can be configured to write log messages to a separate storage, such as link:https://docs.fluentd.org/v0.12/articles/out_s3[S3].

In terms of metrics, curator's deletion age config should not be set shorter than the desired time range that you would like
to see the metrics for.


== Importing Kibana Saved Objects

Kibana is a visualization tool that has a great integration with ElasticSearch.

A template for Kibana saved objects is available. When the saved objects are imported, a number of saved searches, visualizations and a
dashboard are created in Kibana. These then can be used to have an overview of the Voyager application.

See the screenshot of the provided dashboard below.

image::kibana-dashboard-screenshot.png[]

OpenShift logging creates ElasticSearch indices per namespace and the index names have the format `project.<project-name>.<project-uid>`.
For example `project.myproject.49f9a0b6-09b5-11e9-9597-069f7827c758`.

It also creates a Kibana index pattern for that index using the pattern `project.<project-name>.<project-uid>.{asterisk}`.

In order to make sure the Kibana saved objects use the correct index pattern, project UID should be fetched and
fed to the Kibana import template.

[source,bash]
----
PROJECT_NAME=<your_project_name>
# login with your user that has access to your project
oc login
# get project UUID, which is used to build the index name
PROJECT_UUID=`oc get project $PROJECT_NAME -o go-template='{{.metadata.uid}}'`

# replace the placeholders in the template
sed \
    -e "s/<PROJECT_NAME>/${PROJECT_NAME}/g" \
    -e "s/<PROJECT_UUID>/${PROJECT_UUID}/g" \
 kibanaImportTemplate.json > kibanaImport.json
----

A template, `kibanaImportTemplate.json` is available from the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/voyager-server/master/doc/guides/kibanaImportTemplate.json[Voyager GitHub repo].

Once the `kibanaImport.json` file is generated, import it into Kibana:

* Open Kibana using `https://kibana.<domain>.com`. Replace `<domain>` with the name of the cluster's main domain.
* Click *Management* in the left
* Click *Saved Objects*
* Click *Import* and select `kibanaImport.json`

Imported saved objects include the project name or the UID in their names, so that saved objects in differnt namespaces do not affect each other.


[NOTE]
====
No index pattern is created in Kibana if there are no logs generated by an application.

Also, if the fields referenced in the prepared Kibana saved objects do not exist, errors such as the following can be seen:

----
Error: Importing AeroGear Data Sync - top level execution per platform - aaa (top_level_execution_per_platform_49f9a0b6-09b5-11e9-9597-069f7827c758) failed: Could not locate that index-pattern-field (id: audit.clientInfo.data.device.platform.raw)
Error: Could not locate that index-pattern-field (id: audit.clientInfo.data.device.platform.raw)
----

Because of these conditions, Kibana saved objects have to be imported after there are some audit logs already in ElasticSearch.
At the moment, no mechanisms are provided to overcome this problem.
====

= Viewing the Dashboard and Audit Logs

When the Kibana saved objects are imported, a dashboard is available with several visualizations that can be used as an
overview of the Voyager application status.

At the bottom of the dashboard, audit log messages can be explored directly.

For more information on how to use Kibana, see the link:https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana documentation].
