= Provisioning the {sync-service} server application as a service

To provision the {service-name} mobile service:

. Log into the OpenShift console.
. Choose a project where you have previously provisioned Mobile Developer Console.
. Select *Catalog* from the left hand menu.

You can filter the catalog items to only show mobile specific items by selecting the *Mobile* tab.
. Choose the {service-name} service.

. Follow the wizard for provisioning that service.
+
NOTE: If prompted to *Create a Binding*, choose *Do not bind at this time*.

Fill in all of the required parameters for the service:

Once the wizard steps are completed, navigate to the Project Overview in OpenShift to see the newly provisioned service.
Provisioning a service may take some time.

Once the provision is completed, you should be able to see it in the Mobile Developer Console: go to the Mobile Developer Console and click on any mobile client, and you should see the newly provisioned {sync-service} server in the `Unbound Services` section. If you want your client app to use the {sync-service} server, just click on `Bind To App` button and complete the wizard. Once it's bound, copy the updated `mobile-services.json` file to your client app and you can then initialise the {sync-service} client SDK.
