.Prerequisites
* [x] You have Docker installed.
* [x] You have access to an OpenShift cluster with the Service Catalog.
* [x] You have completed the server getting started guide.

= Overview

To connect your Data Sync server and client to other mobile services, you need to run your application in OpenShift.  Data Sync provides a service catalog item to help with this.

Data Sync requires your server application to be packaged as a Docker formatted container and published to a public respository such as link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker hub]. 

= Building and publishing the server container

To build a server into a container, create a `Dockerfile` in the project's directory.  This container will need to include your server source code, its dependencies, and be configured to execute your server.

As an example:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM node:8
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# copy Node.js specific files 
COPY package*.json ./
# copy application source file to the workdir
COPY index.js . 
RUN npm install
# TCP port that application is listening on
EXPOSE 4000
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
---- 

Build the Docker container and tag it:
[source,bash]
----
$ docker build . --tag  <your-repo>/<container-name>
----

Push your container to Dockerhub's repository :
[source,bash]
----
$ docker push <your-repo>/<container-name>
----


= Provisioning {sync-service} Service

|====
|Field|Default|Description
|Sync Application Name||Fill in name of your {sync-service} application

Once the provision is completed, you should be able to see it in the Mobile Developer Console: go to the Mobile Developer Console and click on any mobile client, and you should see the newly provisioned {sync-service} server in the `Unbound Services` section. If you want your client app to use the {sync-service} server, just click on `Bind To App` button and complete the wizard. Once it's bound, copy the updated `mobile-services.json` file to your client app and you can then initialise the {sync-service} client SDK.
