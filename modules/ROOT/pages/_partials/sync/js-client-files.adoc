= File Upload Client

{sync-client} provides support for uploading binary data along with the GraphQL queries.
The binary upload implementation uses the `apollo-upload-client` package built by the Apollo community.

== Introduction

The upload functionality uses the GraphQL multipart form requests specification.
The File upload needs to be implemented on both server and client:

1. On the client HTML FileList objects are mapped into a mutation and sent to the server in a multipart request.

2. On the server: The multipart request is handled. The server processes it and provides an upload argument to a resolver.
In the resolver function, the upload promise resolves an object.

NOTE: File upload is based on link:https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec[graphql-multipart-request-spec].

== Enabling File Upload

File upload feature needs to be enabled by passing `fileUpload` flag to config object:

[source, javascript]
----

const config = {
  ...
  fileUpload: true
  ...
};

//create a new client
----

= Uploading Files from GraphQL

File upload capability adds a new GraphQL scalar `Upload` that can be used for mutations that operate on binary data.
The `Upload` scalar maps html `FileList` HTML5 object in GraphQL schemas.
The first step required to work with binary uploads is to write mutation that will contain `Upload` scalar.
The following example demonstrates how to upload a profile picture:

[source, javascript]
----
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import { Mutation } from 'react-apollo'

export const UPLOAD_PROFILE = gql`
mutation changeProfilePicture($file: Upload!) {
  changeProfilePicture(file: $file) {
    filename
    mimetype
    encoding
  }
}
`;
----


== Executing mutations

The `Upload` scalar will be mapped  to object returned from HTML file input.

The following example shows file upload in a React application.


[source, javascript]
----

const uploadOneFile = () => {
  return (
    <Mutation mutation={UPLOAD_PROFILE}>
      {uploadFile => (
        <input
        type="file"
        required
        onChange={({ target: { validity, files: [file] } }) =>
          validity.valid && uploadFile({ variables: { file } });
        }
       />
      )}
    </Mutation>
  );
};
