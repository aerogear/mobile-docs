= Introducing Data Sync

Data Sync is a JavaScript framework that enables a developer to add real time data synchronization to both mobile and web clients.
The Data Sync framework also provides offline capabilities that allow a client to continue operating offline and once connectivity is re-established, the client is automatically synchronized.
An app built using the Data Sync framework typically connects to a data source for data persistence however, an app built using the Data Sync framework works without a data source.

An app built using the Data Sync framework comprises of two components:

* The Sync Client is a JavaScript client offering client side extensions and server side integration. The Sync Client can be integrated into frameworks such as React and Angular.

* The Sync Server is a framework for building Node.js based GraphQL API.
The Sync Server offers enterprise extensions for ensuring data security, integrity, and monitoring.
It can be integrated into existing Node.js application.

* Real-time data synchronization across mobile and web clients.
** Websockets allow for real-time data synchronization across multiple Sync Clients. Sync Clients receive updates from the Sync Server without having to explicitly query their local data as conflict detection is handled by the Sync Server.

* A Sync Client can perform any operation regardless of the connectivity state.
** If network connectivity is a concern, a Sync Client can perform any operation regardless of its connectivity state. A Sync Client can perform the same operations when it is on-line or off-line, and this functionality ensures that you can safely use Data Sync to create business critical applications.

* Offers fully customizable conflict detection and resolution to the developer.
** Data Sync enables users to detect and resolve conflicts on the Sync Server resulting in the seamless transmission of data to various Sync Clients. Data Sync also allows for conflict resolution on the Sync Client should a developer want to adopt this strategy.

* Instant synchronous queries provide instant feedback for developers.
** When a Sync Client is on-line, instant queries allow a developer to quickly react to errors and display results to users when the operation is executed. Developers can retrieve an instant response or error from the Sync Server however the Sync Client must have a connection to the Sync Server.

* Flexible data sources.
** Data Sync can connect to various data sources, for example, cloud storage, databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and existing back-end data sources.
