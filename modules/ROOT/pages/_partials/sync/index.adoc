Unlike other AeroGear mobile services which provide a server and an API, Data Sync is a library that is used to develop services. Typically, you develop a {sync-service} service as follows:

* Design a link:https://graphql.org/learn[GraphQL] schema
* Develop a server side service and mobile application
* Containerize your server and deploy it to OpenShift as a Data Sync App
* Bind your mobile app to that data sync server app
* Configure your mobile app to point to the data sync server app
* Build and run your mobile app
