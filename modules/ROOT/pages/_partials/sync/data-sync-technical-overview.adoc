|Component|Technical Role
|Sync Client| The Sync Client is a client side JavaScript library used for building web and mobile applications. It allows for simple Sync Server integration.
|Sync Server| The Sync Server is based on the Apollo Server framework and it performs two primary functions. It sends and retrieves data from a data source, and it syncs data across the Sync Clients. Sync Server uses GraphQL to create custom connections that in turn allow various types of Sync Clients to connect.
|Data sources| The data source stores data. This data is typically what is synchronized across the Sync Clients.
