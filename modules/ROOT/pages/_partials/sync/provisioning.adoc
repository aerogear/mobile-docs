Before we provision the {sync-service} server it is neccessary to build it into a Docker formatted container and deploy it to a public registry such as link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub].

= Building and publishing the container

A {sync-service} server is a Node.js application. To build it into a container, create a `Dockerfile` in the project's directory.  This container will need to include your server source code, its dependencies, and be configured to execute your server.

As an example:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM node:8
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# copy Node.js specific files 
COPY package*.json ./
# copy application source file to the workdir
COPY server.js . 
RUN npm install
# TCP port that application is listening on
EXPOSE 4000
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
---- 

Build the Docker container and tag it:
[source,bash]
----
$ docker build . --tag  <your-repo>/<container-name>
----

Push your container to Dockerhub's repository :
[source,bash]
----
$ docker push <your-repo>/<container-name>
----
