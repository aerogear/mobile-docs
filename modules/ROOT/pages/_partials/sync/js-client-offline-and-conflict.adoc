= Supporting offline operations

The {sync-client} provides first class support for performing GraphQL operations while offline. This is because the SDK uses the "cache-first" strategy when perform queries, regardless of the network status of the client. As illustrated in the diagram below, all the queries will be performed against the cache, and the Apollo client will manage filling the cache with data from the server. On top of that, the {sync-client} uses a mutation store to support offline mutations.

The mutation store is effectively a persisted queue, and it is used to hold query and mutation requests when the client is offline. If a client goes offline for a long period of time, it will be able to negotiate local updates with the server using conflict resolution strategies.

When a client becomes online from the offline state, the mutations that are persisted locally will be replicated back to the server, as shown in the diagram below:

image::datasync-going_offline.png[]

Developers can attach listeners to get notification about if a update is applied on the server or not, and take appropriate actions.

== Mutations and Local Cache

By default queries are cached based on the type and `id` field, and the results of performed queries are cached as well and they will be available when the client is offline.

Because of this, when mutations that can change query results are performed, the `refetchQueries` or `update` options of the `mutate` method should be used to ensure the local cache is kept up to date.

In the following example, the app will perform an `ADD_TASK` mutation which will create a new task. The app also has a `GET_TASKS` query to list all the tasks. In order to make sure the cache for the `GET_TASKS` query is kept up to date whenever a new task is created, the `update` option is used to add the newly created task to the cache:

[source, javascript]
----
  client.mutate({
    mutation: ADD_TASK, variables: item,
    update: updateCacheOnAdd
  });

  function updateCacheOnAdd(cache, { data: { createTask } }) {
    let { allTasks } = cache.readQuery({ query: GET_TASKS });
    if (allTasks) {
      if (!allTasks.find((task) => task.id === createTask.id)) {
        allTasks.push(createTask);
      }
    } else {
      allTasks = [createTask];
    }
    cache.writeQuery({
      query: GET_TASKS,
      data: {
        'allTasks': allTasks
      }
    });
  }
----

For more information, see link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/mutations.html#props[Apollo's document about mutations].

== Offline Workflow

If a mutation occurs while the device is offline, the client.mutate function:

- returns immediately
- returns a promise with an error

You can check the _error_ object to isolate errors relating to offline state.
Invoking the `watchOfflineChange()` method on an _error_ object watches for when an offline change is synced with the server, and sends an notification when triggered.
after the device is online again.

For example: 
[source, javascript]
----
  client.mutate(...).catch((error)=> {
    // 1. Detect if this was an offline error
   if(error.networkError && error.networkError.offline){
     const offlineError: OfflineError =  error.networkError;
     // 2. We can still track when offline change is going to be replicated.
     offlineError.watchOfflineChange().then(...)
   }
  });
----

NOTE:  In addition to watching individual mutations, you can add a global offline listener when creating a client.


=== Global Update Functions

Apollo client holds all mutation parameters in memory.
An offline Apollo client will continue to store mutation parameters and once online, it will restore all mutations to memory. Any Update Functions that are supplied to mutations cannot be cached by an Apollo client resulting in the loss of all optimisticResponses after a restart. _Update functions_ supplied to mutations cannot be saved in the cache. 
As a result, all _optimisticResponses_ will disappear from the application after a restart and it will only reappear when the Apollo client becomes online and successfully syncs with the server.

To prevent the loss of all _optimisticResponses_ after a restart, you can configure the _Update Functions_ to restore all _optimisticResponses_.

[source, javascript]
----
const updateFunctions = {
  // Can contain update functions from each component
  ...ItemUpdates,
  ...TasksUpdates
}

let config = {
  mutationCacheUpdates: updateFunctions,
}
----

=== Online Only Queries

To ensure certain queries are only executed when the client is online, a GraphQL directive called `@onlineOnly` can be used to annotate a query, as the example shown below:

[source, graphql]
----
exampleQuery(...) @onlineOnly {
  ...
}

[#sync-client-offline-queue-listener]
== Listening for Events

To handle all notifications about offline related events, use the *offlineQueueListener* listener in the config object

The following events are emitted:

* `onOperationEnqueued` - Called when new operation is being added to offline queue
* `onOperationSuccess` - Called when back online and operation succeeds
* `onOperationFailure` - Called when back online and operation fails with GraphQL error
* `queueCleared` - Called when offline operation queue is cleared

You can use this listener to build User Interfaces that show pending changes.

//TODO: code example

== Conflicts

A *conflict* occurs whenever two or more clients try to modify the same data in between synchronizations.

*Conflict resolution* is how the application detects and resolves the conflict and ensures the correct data is stored. In most cases, the way conflicts are detected and resolved are incredibly specific to an application and the underlying data storage.

The {sync-service} SDK provides some utilities to help applications detect and resolve conflicts on either server or client side. To handle conflicts on client side, developers need to configure their resolvers on the server side to return conflicts back to clients first. For more information, see the <<#sync-server-offline-and-conflict, Voyager server document>>.

If conflicts need to be handled on client side, developers can either use the default conflict resolution implementations, or implement their own ones thanks to the pluggable conflict resolution mechanism.

=== Pluggable Conflict Resolution

Pluggable conflict resolution is a concept that allows developers to implement their own conflict detection and resolution logic regardless of the data storage.

It has two parts: one for detecting conflicts, and the other for resolving conflicts.

To detect conflicts, developers can use either the default version-based conflict detection mechanism, or provide their own implementation via the `conflictStateProvider` option in the config object that is used to initialize the sync client.

To resolve conflicts, developers can either use the default conflict resolution strategy, or provide their own ones via the `conflictStrategy` option in the config object.

//TODO: link to API doc

=== Version Based Conflict Detection

For more details about how it works, see the _server-version-based-conflict-resolution, Voyager server document_.

On the client side, if this default implementation is used, developers need to make sure the version value is always passed to the server when a mutation is invoked.

//TODO: code example

=== Conflict Resolution Strategies

To resolve conflicts on the client side, a `conflictStrategy` needs to be provided. If none is provided, by default, the `clientVersionWins` strategy is used. This means the SDK will automatically override the server data with the current client data.

To implement a custom conflict resolution strategy provide at least one of the parameters below.

* strategies - a dictionary object where each key is the name of a mutation and the value is the custom action for a conflict caused by that mutation
* default - the default behavior to use if one of your mutations is not listed in `strategies`

NOTE: If strategies are provided but no default then `clientVersionWins` becomes the default.
If a mutation causes a conflict and you have not specified a conflict resolution strategy for that mutation, the system uses the `clientVersionWins` strategy.

For example:

[source,javascript]
----

//define a custom conflict resolver
let updateTaskConflictResolver = (serverData, clientData) => {
    ...
    return Object.assign(serverData, clientData);
};

let deleteTaskConflictResolver = (serverData, clientData) => {
    ...
    return serverData;
}

//define a default where the clientData is used
let defaultConflictResolver = (serverData, clientData) => {
    return clientData
}

//pass it to the config object
let config = {
...
  conflictStrategy: {
    strategies: {
      "TaskUpdated": updateTaskConflictResolver,
      "TaskDeleted": deleteTaskConflictResolver
    },
    default: defaultConflictResolver
  }
...
}
----

NOTE: Client strategy is ignored when conflicts are resolved on the server.

=== Listening to Conflicts

Developers can supply their own `conflictListener` implementation to get notifications about conflicts:

[source,javascript]
----
let config = {
...
  conflictListener: {
    conflictOccurred: function(operationName, resolvedData, server, client) {
      console.log(`data: ${JSON.stringify(resolvedData)}, server: ${JSON.stringify(server)} client: ${JSON.stringify(client)} `);
    }
  }
...
}
----
