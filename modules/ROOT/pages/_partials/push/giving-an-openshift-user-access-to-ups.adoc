= Sharing access to the UPS service

== Overview

The UPS service URL is only accessible by users who have *edit* permission for the project. By default, a project owner already has permission.

The UPS service creates routes to access the Unified Push Server . To protect these routes there is an OAuth reverse proxy sidecar container in front of the UPS container to enforce authentication. The authentication is based on Openshift permissions and is configured as part of the provisioning of the UPS service. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy[documentation for the proxy container^] for
more information about configuring the proxy.

== About OAuth proxy permissions
The OAuth proxy, uses a Subject Access Review rule defined in the *deploymentConfig* resource to specify which permissions are required to access the protected
routes. This rule is defined by the `openshift-sar` option. For the UPS service,  the *deploymentConfig* resource in the ups service default definition is:
[source,yaml]
----
   --openshift-sar={"namespace":"ups","resource":"deploymentconfigs","name":"ups","verb":"update"}
----

To authenticate against the OAuth proxy, a user must have
sufficient permissions to update the *deploymentConfig* resource named `ups` in the current Openshift namespace.


NOTE: Giving a user update permissions on a resource allows them to modify that resource object.
Access to the UPS routes requires permissions to completely edit and replace the UPS *deploymentConfig* resources.

== Granting user permissions using the OpenShift web console

. In the Project, select *resources* and click on *Membership*.
. In the membership screen click on *Edit Membership*.
+
. From the *Add Another Role* list, select *edit* and click *add* to assign the role to a user.
+

+
The user can now access the UPS route.

== Granting user permissions using the CLI

. List all users who currently have permissions:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy who-can update dc
----
. Assign the *edit* role to a user:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user edit <user>
----
+
The user can now access the UPS route.

== Using the OAuth proxy to access the UPS service

When the UPS service is provisioned there is a route access to the UPS.
When you access the route you will see the OAuth proxy landing screen.

Click *Log in with Openshift* and log in. If you have sufficient permission to access the route
you are prompted to allow the service account access your account.

Click *Allow selected permissions*. The OAuth proxy redirects you to the requested route.
