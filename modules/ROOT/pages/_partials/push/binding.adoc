iOS::

--
- Select `iOS` from the `Mobile Client Type` list.
- Obtain an APNs client TLS certificate. Refer to link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide]. 
- Encode the certificate using base64 and paste the encoded certificate into the field labeled `iOS .p12 file`. 
+
If you are using macOS:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64
----
+
If you are using Linux, chances are that you are using a version of the base64 tool that does line wrapping.
Disable base64 line wrapping by using `--wrap=0` flag:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64 --wrap=0
----
