= Obtaining Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials

This procedure describes how to obtain Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials.

.Prerequisites

* Before the Android application is able to receive the notifications, you must set up access to Firebase Cloud Messaging:

 As with iOS, you are only able to test out your push notifications in a real device.
 The following credentials are necessary to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for your app:
 * the **Server key**
 * the **Sender ID**
 * the `google-services.json` file containing the credentials required to connect your app to Firebase and Google services.

.Procedure

. From the _Project Settings_ screen, switch to the _Cloud Messaging_ tab, where you can find the **Server key** and **Sender ID** (known in GCM as **Project Number**). There is also a _Legacy server key_ but it should not be used for new projects.

. Download the `google-services.json` file as described in the link:https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en[Google Documentation, window="_blank"].
