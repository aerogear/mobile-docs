= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {unifiedpush-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

This section describes how to set up the {unifiedpush-service} service.

- Select `iOS` from the `Mobile Client Type` list.

- Obtain an APNs client TLS certificate. Refer to link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide]. 
- Encode the certificate using base64 and paste the encoded certificate into the field labeled `iOS .p12 file`.

If you are using macOS:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64
----
+
If you are using Linux and a version of `base64` that wraps lines, disable line wrapping as follows:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64 --wrap=0
----
