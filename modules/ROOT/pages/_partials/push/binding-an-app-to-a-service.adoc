= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {unifiedpush-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

This section describes how to set up the {unifiedpush-service} service.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {mobile-client}.

NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console, however such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Press *Bind to App* in the {service-name}.
. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.

+
When you bind a mobile client to the {unifiedpush-service} service, a variant is created to store the credentials required to communicate with a push network.
Those credentials need to be provided in the binding dialog.

First pick your *Mobile Client Type*. Depending on the selection you then have to fill out the fields for either Android or iOS.

You need to provide a *Server Key* and a *Sender ID*. Both can be found in the Firebase console under *Project{nbsp}Settings{nbsp}>{nbsp}Cloud Messaging*. Make sure that you have selected `Android` in the `Mobile Client Type` dropdown.

You need an APNs client TLS certificate. Have a look at link:apple-setup.html[APNs Setup] for instructions on how to obtain one. Make sure that you have selected `iOS` in the `Mobile Client Type` dropdown.
The certificate needs to be encoded in base64 before copying it into the field labelled `iOS .p12 file`. If you're on Mac OS run:

----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64
----

If you're on Linux chances are that you're using a version of the base64 tool that does line wrapping. You need to disable this:

----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64 --wrap=0
----

After clicking *Create* your variant will be created in UPS and you should see a new binding for your mobile client.
