= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {unifiedpush-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {mobile-client}.

NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console, however such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Press *Bind to App* in the {service-name}.
. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
+
When you bind a mobile client to the {unifiedpush-service} service, a variant is created to store the credentials required to communicate with a push network.
Those credentials need to be provided in the binding dialog.
+
Choose a *Mobile Client Type* and fill out the required fields:

iOS::

--
- Select `iOS` from the `Mobile Client Type` list.
- Obtain an APNs client TLS certificate. Refer to link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide]. 
- Encode the certificate using base64 and paste the encoded certificate into the field labeled `iOS .p12 file`. 
+
If you are using macOS:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64
----
+
If you are using Linux and a version of `base64` that wraps lines, disable line wrapping as follows:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64 --wrap=0
