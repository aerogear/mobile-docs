= Obtaining Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials

Before the Android application is able to receive the notifications, you must set up access to Firebase Cloud Messaging. As with iOS, you are only able to test out your push notifications in a real device. The following credentials are necessary to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for your app:

* the **Server key**
* the **Sender ID**
* the `google-services.json` file containing the credentials required to connect your app to Firebase and Google services.

. From the _Project Settings_ screen, switch to the _Cloud Messaging_ tab, where you can find the **Server key** and **Sender ID** (known in GCM as **Project Number**). There is also a _Legacy server key_ but it should not be used for new projects.

. Download the `google-services.json` file as described in the link:https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en[Google Documentation^].
