= {sync-service}

NOTE: This is only available in the Cordova showcase app.

NOTE: To demonstrate all the features that {sync-service} offers, it's best to run the same app on multiple devices at the same time.

From the showcase app:

. Press the *Manage Tasks* menu item.
. View tasks created by other people and try to edit them. See them changed on other devices.
. Create new tasks and see them show up on other devices.
. Bring the device offline by switching to *Airplane Mode*, create a few more tasks and edit a few existing tasks. Then switch the device back online and see them changed on other devices.
