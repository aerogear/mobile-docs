== Setting up Mobile Services to Demonstrate Showcase Apps

[discrete]
=== Prerequisites

* [x] You are running OpenShift with {product-name} as described in xref:getting-started.adoc[Setting up AeroGear {product-name} on OpenShift].

[discrete]
=== Procedure
. To demonstrate {metrics-service}, xref:mobile-metrics.adoc#provisioning-metrics-service[Provision the {metrics-service} service] For more information about features, see xref:mobile-metrics.adoc[{metrics-service} Service]

. To demonstrate {keycloak-service}:

.. xref:identity-management.adoc#provisioning-the-identity-management-service[Provision the {keycloak-service} service].

.. xref:identity-management.adoc#configuring-the-service[Set up the {keycloak-service} service].

.. Create a new user to authenticate as. Follow the steps link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/users/create-user.html[here].

.. Set credentials for the created user. Follow the steps link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/users/credentials.html[here].

For more information about features, see xref:identity-management.adoc[{keycloak-service} Service]


. To demonstrate {unifiedpush-service}, xref:push-notifications.adoc#provisioning-push-notifications-service[Provision the {unifiedpush-service} service]. For more information about features, see xref:push-notifications.adoc[{unifiedpush-service} Service]

. To demonstrate {sync-service}:
+
NOTE: You can only demonstrate {sync-service} on Cordova.

.. Provision a PostgreSQL database if there isn't one available.
... Login to the OpenShift web console, create a new project or use an existing one
... Click on the `Add to Project` dropdown on the top right, and choose `Browse Catalog`
... Select `Databases` -> `Postgres` -> `PostgreSQL`, and complete the wizard to start the deployment of the database. Take notes of the values for `PostgreSQL Connection Username`, `PostgreSQL Connection Password` and `PostgreSQL Database Name`. You will need them later.
.. Provision a new {sync-service} app from the catalog as described in xref:data-sync.adoc#sync-server-openshift[Running Data Sync in OpenShift] with the following parameters:
+
[options="header"]

== Setting Up the Showcase App

[discrete]
=== Prerequisites

=== Procedure

1. Clone the showcase app and checkout the release tag {release-number}

//[[downloading-the-mobile-services-configuration-file]]
= Downloading the Mobile Services Configuration File

NOTE: This section only applies to the Ionic platform.

. Open your {mobile-client} in Mobile Developer Console.
. Copy the `mobile-services.json` configuration to your clipboard.
 Save the contents of the clipboard to a new file called `mobile-services.json`.
+
NOTE: The mobile-services.json file is the link between your provisioned services on OpenShift and the mobile app you are developing. This file provides all required configuration to initialise the various SDKs and get them hooked up/connected to the back-end services.
. Copy the contents of `mobile-services.json` and add it to the contents of the `config` object located in `src/mobile-services.js`, for example:

[source,javascript]
----
let config = {
  "version": 1,
  "namespace": "voyager",
  "clientId": "voyager-ionic-example",
  "services": []
};

module.exports = config;
