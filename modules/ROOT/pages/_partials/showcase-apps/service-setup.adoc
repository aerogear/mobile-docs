=== Prerequisites

* [x] You are running OpenShift with {product-name} as described in xref:getting-started.adoc[Setting up AeroGear {product-name} on OpenShift].

[discrete]
=== Procedure
. To demonstrate {metrics-service}, xref:mobile-metrics.adoc#provisioning-metrics-service[Provision the {metrics-service} service] For more information about features, see xref:mobile-metrics.adoc[{metrics-service} Service]

. To demonstrate {keycloak-service}:

.. xref:identity-management.adoc#provisioning-the-identity-management-service[Provision the {keycloak-service} service].

.. xref:identity-management.adoc#configuring-the-service[Set up the {keycloak-service} service].

.. Create a new user to authenticate as. Follow the steps link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/users/create-user.html[here].

. To demonstrate {unifiedpush-service}, xref:push-notifications.adoc#provisioning-push-notifications-service[Provision the {unifiedpush-service} service]. For more information about features, see xref:push-notifications.adoc[{unifiedpush-service} Service]

. To demonstrate {sync-service}:

.. Provision a PostgreSQL database if there isn't one available. 
... Login to the OpenShift web console, create a new project or use an existing one
... Click on the `Add to Project` dropdown on the top right, and choose `Browse Catalog`
... Select `Databases` -> `Postgres` -> `PostgreSQL`, and complete the wizard to start the deployment of the database. Take notes of the values for `PostgreSQL Connection Username`, `PostgreSQL Connection Password` and `PostgreSQL Database Name`. You will need them later.
.. Provision a new {sync-service} app from the catalog as described in xref:data-sync.adoc#sync-server-openshift[Running Data Sync in OpenShift] with the following parameters:
