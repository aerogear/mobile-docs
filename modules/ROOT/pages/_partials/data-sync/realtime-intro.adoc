= Introduction to real-time updates

After you have developed some queries and mutations, you might want to implement real-time updates.
These are supported in the GraphQL specification by an operation type called `Subscription`.
To support scalable, reliable subscriptions in a production environment, Data Sync implements subscriptions using an MQTT PubSub subscription mechanism, however you might want to use the Apollo PubSub module to develop proof-of-concept applications.  

When coding for real-time updates, you use the following modules:

* @aerogear/voyager-server - supports clients that use voyager-client to enable GraphQL queries and mutations
* @aerogear/voyager-subscriptions - supports clients that use voyager-client to enable GraphQL subscriptions
* @aerogear/graph-mqtt-subscriptions - supports GraphQL resolvers connections to a MQTT broker

GraphQL Subscriptions enable clients to subscribe to server events over a websocket connection.

The flow can be summarized as follows:

* Client connects to the server using websockets, and subscribes to certain events.
* As events occur, the server notifies the clients that are subscribed to those events.
* Any _currently connected_ client that is subscribed to a given event receives it.
* The client can close the connection at any time and no longer receives updates.

To receive updates, the client must be currently connected to the server.
The client does not receive events from subscriptions while offline.
To support inactive clients, use Push Notifications.

{sync-client} comes with subscription support out of the box including auto-reconnection upon device restart or network reconnect.
