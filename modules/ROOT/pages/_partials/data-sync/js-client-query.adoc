= Querying a Data Sync server using a Data Sync client

.Prerequisites
* You have Node.js and npm installed.
* You have created an empty web project that supports ES6, for example, using the link:https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/[webpack getting started] guide.
* You have completed the server getting started guide and the application is running.

This section describes how to use the {sync-client} to create mobile and web applications that can communicate with the Voyager server application.

Data Sync provides JavaScript libraries which integrate your javascript app using with a server that also uses Data Sync.  
The client libraries are based on the link:https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html[Apollo client].

You will add the libraries to your mobile project, configure the client classes, connect to the server, and confirm that it works.

. Create an address book server:
.. Create an `index-2.js` file with the following content:
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{remote-loc}index-2.js[]
----

.. Run the server:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ node index-2.js

ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
----

.. Browse `http://localhost:4000/graphql` and interact with the playground. For example:
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  addressBook {
    name
    address
    
  }
}
----

.. Check the output. For the example above, the output should be:
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "data": {
    "addressBook": [
      {
        "name": "Alice Roberts",
        "address": "1 Red Square, Waterford"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----




. Add the following libraries to your javascript client:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install @aerogear/voyager-client
npm install graphql-tag
----
+
NOTE: A prerequisite is that you have created an empty web project that supports ES6, for example, using the link:https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/[webpack getting started] guide.

. Create an `index.js` file to make the same query as step 1, but from JavaScript. 
+
In this example, a config object is created, and the `httpUrl` field is set to the url of the Voyager server application. 
If the client app uses subscriptions, then the `wsUrl` field is required too.
+
.src/index.js
[source,javascript]
----
// gql is a utility function that handles gql queries
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

import { OfflineClient } from '@aerogear/voyager-client';

// connect to the local service.
let config = {
  httpUrl: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
  wsUrl: "ws://localhost:4000/graphql",
}

async function queryPeople() {

  // Actually create the client
  let offlineClient = new OfflineClient(config);
  let client = await offlineClient.init();

  // Execute the query
  client.query({
      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
      query: gql`
      query addressBook{
        addressBook{
        name
        address
        }
      }
      `
    })
    //Print the response of the query
    .then( ({data}) => {
      console.log(data.addressBook)
    });
}

queryPeople();
----

. Build and run the client application.
. Browse the client application and check the console output.
+
It should include an array similar to the following:
+
----
address: "1 Red Square, Waterford"
name: "Alice Roberts"
__typename: "Person"
----
