[id="conflict-resolution-introduction"]

= Introduction

Applications that allow users to modify data while offline must deal with conflicts. A *conflict* occurs when two or more clients try to modify the same data in between synchronizations.

*Example:* A user modifies a record while offline. When back online, they discover that the record has been deleted by another user.

Discussions about conflicts can be broken down into two parts.

* *Conflict Detection* is the ability of an application to detect the presence of outdated data which cannot be stored without possible data loss occuring.

* *Conflict Resolution* is how the application handles the conflict and ensures the correct data is stored.

In most cases, the way conflicts are detected and resolved are specific to an application and the underlying data storage. You implement conflict detection exclusively in the code associated with mutations.

{sync-server} provides conflict detection on the server side while {sync-client} provides conflict resolution on the client side.
