[id="conflict-resolution-introduction"]

= Introduction

Typically, mobile apps allow users to modify data while offline, which results in conflicts. 
A *conflict* occurs when two or more users try to modify the same data.

For example, a user modifies a record while offline, and another user deletes that record at the same time. 
The system needs to resolve the conflicting data.

Conflict resolution can be handled in two phases:

* *Conflict detection* is the ability of an application to detect the possibility of incorrect data being stored.

* *Conflict resolution* is the process of ensuring that the correct data is stored.

With {org-name} Data Sync:

* You implement conflict detection exclusively in the code associated with mutations.

* The {sync-server} module provides conflict detection on the server side.

* The {sync-client} module provides conflict resolution on the client side.
