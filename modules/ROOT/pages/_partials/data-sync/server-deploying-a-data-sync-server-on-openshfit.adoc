= Deploying a Data Sync server on OpenShift

This section describes how to deploy an app built using the Data Sync framework to OpenShift.
The app is built from source code. For more information, see https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server[Apollo Voyager Server].

For this procedure, an example app is deployed to an OpenShift environment.
For more information, see xref:server-getting-started-with-an-example-data-source-{context}[Getting started with an example data source].

.Prerequisites

* You have a running OpenShift environment.
* You have forked the link:https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server[Apollo Voyager Server] and the forked repo must be public.
* You understand `git`.

.Procedure

. If the {sync-server} is running, stop it.
+
. Copy the contents from `index.js` and use this code to replace the contents in `examples/basic/server.js`.
+
. Save these changes and commit the changes to your forked github repository.
+
. Create a blank `yaml` file locally.
+
. Open the `yaml` file and copy the following code into the `yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]

. Replace the value `https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server` with the URL for your github repo, and save the file.
+
. Log in to the environment and browse to a project.
+
. Click *Add to Project > Import YAML/JSON* to open a screen that allows the user to input raw `yaml` code.
+
. Copy the contents from the local `yaml` file and paste it into the input box (that was opened in the point above).
+
. Click *Create* and then *Continue*.
+
. Review the information and click *Create*.
+
Note: The value for the _Git Repository URL_ should match the URL for your github repo.
+
. Once your application is created, click *Close*.

.Verification steps

. Click *Applications > Deployments* to display the _Deployments_ screen.
+
. Click on the name of your application to view the deployment options.
+
. Click *Environment* and then input `NODE_ENV` into the _Name_ field and `development` into the accompanying _Value_ field.
+
Note: This triggers an automatic redeployment.
+
. Browse to the _Overview_ screen and click on the URL to open your application in a browser.
+
Note: _ok_ is displayed in the browser.
+
. Add `qraphql` to the end of the URL to open GraphQL in the browser.
+
. To list Employees, execute the following command in the GraphQL window:
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  listEmployees
  {
    employee_id,
    employee_name
  }
}
----
+
. The output is displayed:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "data": {
    "listEmployees": [
      {
        "employee_id": "1",
        "employee_name": "joe"
      },
      {
        "employee_id": "2",
        "employee_name": "john"
      }
    ]
  }
}
