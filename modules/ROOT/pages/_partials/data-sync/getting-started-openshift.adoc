* You have completed the server getting started guide.

= Overview

To connect your Data Sync server and client to other services, you need to run your application in OpenShift.  Data Sync provides a service catalog item to help with this.

Data Sync requires your server application to be packaged as a Docker formatted container and published to a public respository such as link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker hub].

= Building and publishing the {sync-service} server container

To build a server into a container, create a `Dockerfile` in the project's directory.  This container will need to include your server source code, its dependencies, and be configured to execute your server.

As an example:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM node:8
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# copy Node.js specific files
COPY package*.json ./
# copy application source file to the workdir
COPY index.js .
RUN npm install
# TCP port that application is listening on
EXPOSE 4000
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
----

Build the Docker container and tag it:
[source,bash]
----
$ docker build . --tag  <your-repo>/<container-name>
----

Push your container to Dockerhub's repository:
[source,bash]
----
$ docker push <your-repo>/<container-name>
----
