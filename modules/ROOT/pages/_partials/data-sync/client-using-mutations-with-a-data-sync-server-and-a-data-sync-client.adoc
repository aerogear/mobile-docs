= Using Mutations with a Data Sync Server and a Data Sync Client

Build a Data Sync Client that uses mutations on a Data Sync Server.
Both the Data Sync Client and the Data Sync Server will be running locally in this procedure.

.Prerequisites

* The example in link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-docs/blob/master/modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/data-sync/server-create-a-graphql-schema-for-an-existing-data-source.adoc[Getting started with an example data source schema] runs locally.
* Basic knowledge of `npm`.

.Procedure

. Create a basic link:https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/[_webpack project_] repo.
+
. Open a terminal and navigate into the cloned project.
+
. To add the necessary Data Sync Client javascript libraries to your basic _webpack project_, execute the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install @aerogear/voyager-client
npm install graphql-tag
----
+
. Before continuing, build the project and ensure that it successfully builds by executing `npm run build` - the output should be similar to:
+
[source,bash]

. Replace the contents of `/src/index.js` with:
+
[source,javascript]
----
// gql is a utility function that handles gql queries
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

import { OfflineClient } from '@aerogear/voyager-client';

// For our client application, we will connect to the local service.
let config = {
  httpUrl: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
  wsUrl: "ws://localhost:4000/graphql",
}

async function queryEmployees() {

  // Actually create the client
  let offlineClient = new OfflineClient(config);
  let client = await offlineClient.init();

  // Execute the query
  client.query({
      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
      query: gql`
      {
        listEmployees
        {
      		employee_id,
          employee_name,
        }
      }
      `
    })
    //Print the response of the query
    .then( ({data}) => {
      document.write(JSON.stringify(data))
    });
}

queryEmployees();
----
+
. Build the project again by executing `npm run build` - the _size_ of the `main.js` file should have increased:
+
[source,bash]

.Verification steps

. Ensure that link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-docs/blob/master/modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/data-sync/server-create-a-graphql-schema-for-an-existing-data-source.adoc[Getting started with an example data source schema] is running.
+
. Open `/dist/index.html` in a web browser.
+
. Open the web browser's _Console_.
+
. Expand the data in the Console and you should see the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
0:{employee_id: "1", employee_name: "joe", __typename: "Employee"}
1:{employee_id: "2", employee_name: "john", __typename: "Employee"}
length:2
