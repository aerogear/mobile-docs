= Getting Started with Hello World {sync-service}

In this example, you add the {sync-server} library to your link:https://expressjs.com/[Express] node.js project, create an `index-1.js` file, run the server, and query GraphQL.

* {sync-server} is a set of Node.js libraries that can be used to build a Data Sync server.

* {sync-server} is the starting point for developing a {sync-service} application. 


.Prerequisites

* You have Node.js and npm installed.
* You have created a node.js project.

.Procedure

. Add libraries to your Node.js application:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
$ npm install graphql <1>
$ npm install express <2>
$ npm install @aerogear/voyager-server <3>
----

<1> See https://graphql.org/
<2> See https://expressjs.com/
<3> The {sync-server} library that enables data sync
====

. Create an `index-1.js` file with the following content:
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::index-1.js[]
----

. Run the server:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ node index-1.js

ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
----

. Browse `http://localhost:4000/graphql` and interact with the playground. For example:
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  hello
}
----

. Check the output. For the example above, the output should be:
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello world"
  }
}
----

To get started with the  {sync-service} framework, see the link:https://github.com/aerogear/ionic-showcase[sample application].
In this app, you can explore a more complex schema.

Before proceeding, make sure you have an understanding of the following GraphQL concepts:

* Schema design
* Resolvers
* Subscriptions
