[id="server-create-a-graphql-schema-for-an-existing-data-source-{context}"]
= Create a GraphQL schema for an existing data source schema.

Create a GraphQL schema for an existing data source schema.

.Prerequisites

* link:https://github.com/jstaffor/mobile-docs/blob/master/modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/sync/server-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with Hello World Data Sync].
* You are familiar with {sync-server} operations, for example, stopping and starting {sync-server}.

.Procedure

. If the {sync-server} is running, stop it.
+
. Edit the `index.js` file and replace its contents with the following content:
+
[source,javascript]
----
const express = require('express')
//Include our server libraries
const { VoyagerServer, gql } = require('@aerogear/voyager-server')

// Stub that reflects data source mapping
const employees = [{employee_id: 1, employee_name: "joe", cateory_id: 1 }, {employee_id: 2, employee_name: "john", cateory_id: 2}];

const categories = [{category_id: 1, employee_type:"Manager", security_clearance: 1}, {category_id: 2, employee_type:"Associate", security_clearance: 2}];

//GraphQL schema for mapping to data source mapping
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Employee {
      employee_id: ID!,
      employee_name: String!
      category: Category
  }
  type Category {
      category_id: ID!,
      employee_type: String!,
      security_clearance: ID!
  }
  type Query {
    listEmployees: [Employee]
  }
`

//Create the resolvers for your schema
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    listEmployees: (obj, args, context, info) => {
      return employees;
    }
  },
  Employee: {
    category(employee) {
        return filter(categories, {category_id: employee.cateory_id});
    }
  }
}

//Initialize the library with your GraphQL information
const server = VoyagerServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
})

//Connect the server to express
const app = express()
server.applyMiddleware({ app })

app.listen(4000, () =>
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql`)
)
----
+
. Start the server.
+
. Open an internet browser and browse to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
+
. To list Employees, execute the following command in the GraphQL window:
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  listEmployees
  {
    employee_id,
    employee_name,
  }
}
----

.Verification steps

For the example above, the output should be:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "data": {
    "listEmployees": [
      {
        "employee_id": "1",
        "employee_name": "joe"
      },
      {
        "employee_id": "2",
        "employee_name": "john"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
