= Configuring a Publish Subscribe mechanism

You can use the Apollo PubSub mechanism for development, but you must use the MQTT PubSub mechanism for production.

== Using the Apollo PubSub mechanism

The xref:realtime-updates-{context}[] section describes how to set up the default `PubSub` provided by `apollo-server`. For a production system, you require link:npm.im/@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions[MQTT PubSub].


== Using the MQTT PubSub mechanism

// TODO: check link
The https://npm.im/@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions[`@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions`] module provides an `AsyncIterator` interface used for xref:realtime-updates-{context}[implementing subscription resolvers]
It connects the {sync-service} server to an MQTT broker to support horizontally scalable subscriptions.



Initialize an MQTT client and pass that client to the `@aerogeaar/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions` module, for example:

[%collapsible]
====
[source,js]
----
const mqtt = require('mqtt')
const { MQTTPubSub } = require('@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions')

const client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://test.mosquitto.org', {
  reconnectPeriod: 1000,
})

const pubsub = new MQTTPubSub({
  client
})
----
====

In the example, an `mqtt` client is created using `mqtt.connect` and then this client is passed into an `MQTTPubSub` instance. 
The `pubsub` instance can then be used to publish and subscribe to events in the server.

// TODO maybe link or show example code in showcase app?
