= GraphQL MQTT PubSub Setup

This section specifically describes how to set up an MQTT `PubSub` for powering GraphQL subscriptions. For more generic information about PubSub mechanisms, read xref:realtime-updates-{context}[Configure a Publish Subscribe Mechanism].

The https://npm.im/@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions[`@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions`] module provides an `AsyncIterator` interface used for xref:realtime-updates-{context}[implementing subscription resolvers]
It connects the {sync-service} server to an MQTT broker to support horizontally scalable subscriptions.

.Procedure

. Initialize an MQTT client and pass it into `@aerogeaar/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions`

[%collapsible]
====
[source,js]
----
const mqtt = require('mqtt')
const { MQTTPubSub } = require('@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions')

const client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://test.mosquitto.org', {
  reconnectPeriod: 1000,
})

const pubsub = new MQTTPubSub({
  client
})
----
====

In the example, an mqtt client is created using `mqtt.connect` and then this client is passed into an `MQTTPubSub` instance. This `pubsub` can now be used to publish and subscribe to events in the server.
