= Implementing real-time updates on a Data Sync server 

The follow code shows typical code for a Data Sync Server without subscriptions:

[%collapsible]
====
[source,js]
----
const apolloServer = VoyagerServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
})

const app = express()
apolloServer.applyMiddleware({ app })

app.listen({ port }, () =>
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:${port}${apolloServer.graphqlPath}`)
)
----
====

The following sections outline the steps required to enable real-time updates:

. Implement a SubscriptionServer
. Implement a Publish Subscribe Mechanism
. Define subscriptions in the schema
. Implement resolvers

== Implementing a SubscriptionServer using voyager-subscription

To allow you create GraphQL subscription types in your schema:

. Install the `@aerogear/voyager-subscriptions` package:
+
----
$ npm i @aerogear/voyager-subscriptions
----

. Configure SubscriptionServer using `@aerogear/voyager-subscriptions`
+
[%collapsible]
====
[source,js]
----
const { createSubscriptionServer } = require('@aerogear/voyager-subscriptions')

const apolloServer = VoyagerServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
})

const app = express()
apolloServer.applyMiddleware({ app })
const port = 4000

const server = app.listen({ port }, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:${port}${apolloServer.graphqlPath}`)

  createSubscriptionServer({ schema: apolloServer.schema }, {
    server,
    path: '/graphql'
  })
})
----
====
+
The `createSubscriptionServer` code:
+
* returns a `SubscriptionServer` instance 
* installs handlers for 
** managing websocket connections
** delivering subscriptions on the server
* provides integrations with other modules such as `@aerogear/voyager-keycloak`.

== Implementing a Publish Subscribe Mechanism

WARNING: This procedure describes an in-memory implementation which is useful for prototyping but not suitable for production. {org-name} recommends using link:npm.im/@aerogear/graphql-mqtt-subscriptions[MQTT PubSub] in production. See xref:pub-sub[] for more information about all the implementation methods.

To provide a channel to push updates to the client using the default `PubSub` provided by `apollo-server`, you implement a Publish Subscribe mechanism, for example:

[%collapsible]
====
[source,js]
----
const { PubSub } = require('apollo-server')

const pubsub = new PubSub()
----
====

.Addtional Information
Subscriptions depend on a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern[publish subscribe] mechanism to generate the events that notify a subscription. There are https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/subscriptions/#pubsub-implementations[several PubSub implementations] available based on the `PubSubEngine` interface.


== Defining subscriptions in the schema

Subscriptions are a root level type. 
They are defined in the schema similar to `Query` and `Mutation`. 
For example, in the following schema, a `Task` type is defined and so are mutations and subscriptions.

[%collapsible]
====
----
type Subscription {
  taskCreated: Task
}

type Mutation {
  createTask(title: String!, description: String!): Task
}

type Task {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
}
----
====


== Implementing resolvers

Inside the resolver map, subscription resolvers return an `AsyncIterator,` which listens for events.
To generate an event, call the `publish` method. 
The `pubsub.publish` code is typically located inside a mutation resolver.

In the following example, when a new task is created, the `createTask` resolver publishes the result of this mutation to the `TaskCreated` channel.

[%collapsible]
====
[source,js]
----
const TASK_CREATED = 'TaskCreated'

const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    taskCreated: {
      subscribe: () => pubSub.asyncIterator(TASK_CREATED)
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    createTask: async (obj, args, context, info) => {
      const task = tasks.create(args)
      pubSub.publish(TASK_CREATED, { taskCreated: task })
      return task
    }
  },
}

NOTE: This subscription server does not implement authentication or authorization. For information about implementing authenication and authorization, see link:{data-sync-auth-link}[Supporting authentication and authorization in your mobile app].
