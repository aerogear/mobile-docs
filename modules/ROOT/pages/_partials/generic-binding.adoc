To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in OpenShift using a {mobile-client} and that {mobile-client} must be associated with the mobile service. 
After binding a {mobile-client} to the {service-name} service, your mobile app can use that service immediately. 

NOTE: The association between a {mobile-client} and {service-name} service uses the xref:https://blog.openshift.com/asynchronous-bind-with-the-automation-broker/[OpenShift bind] feature.

To associate a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Navigate to the *Overview* of your OpenShift project.

. Expand the {mobile-client} by clicking the *>* icon.
+
NOTE: Your mobile app will be represented by two items in OpenShift, an item in the *{mobile-client}s* list and an item in the *Provisioned Services* list. Make sure to expand the item in the *{mobile-client}s* list.

. Note the value for `clientId` in the *Config Info* field. This is required for the next step.

. Choose the {service-name} service from the *Integrations* list. If an option is not available, you can provision that service by choosing that option and associate the {mobile-client} later.

. Follow the *Create Binding* wizard to associate the {mobile-client} with the {service-name} service. 
When prompted for a *{mobile-client} ID*, enter the value you noted from the previous step.
