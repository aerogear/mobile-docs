To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in OpenShift using a {mobile-client} and that {mobile-client} must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called a binding and once it's done, your mobile app can use that service immediately.

NOTE: The association between a {mobile-client} and {service-name} Service uses the link:https://blog.openshift.com/asynchronous-bind-with-the-automation-broker/[Service Broker bind] feature.

To associate a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Click *Create Binding* and follow the *Create Binding* wizard to associate the {mobile-client} with the {service-name} Service.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
