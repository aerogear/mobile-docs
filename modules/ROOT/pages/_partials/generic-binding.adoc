To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

include::./generic-binding-procedure.adoc[]

. Press *Bind to App* in the {service-name}
. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
