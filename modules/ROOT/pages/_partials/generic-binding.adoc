To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in OpenShift using a {mobile-client}, and that {mobile-client} must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

To associate a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

include::{partialsdir}/generic-binding-procedure.adoc[]

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
