. Click the *Apps* tab and then choose the mobile platform (Android, iOS, Cordova or Xamarin) and follow the wizard.

NOTE: On the wizard's *configuration* screen, it is recommended that you input the name of the showcase application into the *Package Name* text box.

NOTE: When registering an iOS app, you are prompted for a bundle id. See the link:https://cocoacasts.com/what-are-app-ids-and-bundle-identifiers/[description of bundle identifiers] for more information.

After the {mobile-client} is provisioned, you can navigate to it from Project Overview. The {mobile-client} view displays a list of mobile services that you can associate with the {mobile-client}, and offers to provision any mobile service that is in the service catalog but is not currently provisioned.
