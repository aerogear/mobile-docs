= Setting up {org-name} {product-name} on OpenShift

To use {product-name}, you must run OpenShift and install an add-on which enables {product-name}. For more information about OpenShift, see https://www.openshift.org/.

NOTE: {org-name} recommends running OpenShift using the method described in this document. However, there are many ways to run OpenShift, and {product-name} is compatible with most of these methods. There is a known issue with Minishift that makes it unsuitable for mobile development. This issue is described in link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/1287[].

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* MacOS or Linux
* A system capable of running OpenShift as described in link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#prerequisites[Local Cluster Management]

* A link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] account

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible] (version 2.6 or above)

* link:https://www.openshift.org/download.html[OpenShift client tools] version 3.9 or later
+
WARNING: OpenShift oc executable must be located in a system location that is known to all shells (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
+
NOTE: Ensure that you can run link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#getting-started[oc cluster up] with no errors before moving on to the installation of AeroGear.
+
For Linux (Fedora), add an extra port to the `dockerc` zone:
[source,sh]
----
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --zone dockerc --add-port 443/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --reload
----

WARNING: Firewall issues may arise on Linux if you try to interact with services on a local cluster from an external device. In order to overcome these issues, you can add the ports to your firewall. Depending on the port your service uses, an example of the ports you may want to add to your firewall are

----
$ firewall-cmd --add-port 443/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --add-port 80/tcp
----


[[procedure]]
== Procedure

. Clone the Mobile-core installer:
+
The installer configures the local development installation of {org-name} {product-name} using ansible scripts in our link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core[mobile-core] repo.
+
Clone this repo to your local machine and check out the {release-number} tag using:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core.git
cd mobile-core
git checkout {release-number}
----

. In the same directory, run the installer:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./installer/install.sh
----
+
The installer checks that valid versions of Ansible, Docker and the OpenShift Client Tools
are installed.

. Enter your Docker Hub login credentials when prompted. The installer checks these credentials are valid before continuing.

. Accept the default values for the next set of prompts, unless you have specific requirements and understand the implications of changing the values.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
DockerHub Tag (Defaults to latest):
DockerHub Organisation (Defaults to aerogearcatalog):
Cluster IP (Defaults to < Network IP Address >)
Wildcard DNS Host (Defaults to nip.io):
----
+
The first two values configure the location of the APBs used for the service-catalog in the cluster you are creating.
+
The *Cluster IP* value defaults to the IP address of your primary network interface. If you want to connect to your OpenShift instance from a mobile device, ensure that your device is on the same network.
+
Typically, you should ensure you are using the IP Address of your Wireless Adapter (if one exists).
+
The *Wildcard DNS Host* option alters the wildcard DNS host you want to use.
+
The following installation can take a while the first time it runs, as it pulls a number of Docker images. Once completed successfully, this results in an output similar to the following:

+

The log above is displayed after a successful installation.

. Verify the installation:
+
.. Open a browser and login (accepting the self-signed certificate):
+
----
https://192.168.37.1:8443/console/
----
+
The developer login credentials are:
+
----
username: developer
password: password
----

.. At the top of the catalog package, find the *Mobile* category that indicates that the mobile features of {org-name} {product-name} are successfully installed.
