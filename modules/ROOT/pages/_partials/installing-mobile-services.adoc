= Setting up {org-name} {product-name} on OpenShift

To use {product-name}, you must run OpenShift and install an add-on which enables {product-name}. For more information about OpenShift, see link:https://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift website, window="_blank"].

NOTE: {org-name} recommends running OpenShift using the method described in this document. However, there are many ways to run OpenShift, and {product-name} is compatible with most of these methods. There is a known issue with Minishift that makes it unsuitable for mobile development. This issue is described in link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/1287[Issue 1287, window="_blank"].

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* MacOS or Linux
+
NOTE: Due to an link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/18747[OpenShift bug], {product-name} will not run on RHEL/CentOS 7.4 or RHEL/CentOS 7.5.

* A system running OpenShift `oc cluster up` as described in link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#prerequisites[Local Cluster Management, window="_blank"]

** Use link:https://www.openshift.org/download.html[OpenShift client tools, window="_blank"] version 3.9 or later
+
IMPORTANT: OpenShift oc executable must be located in a system location that is known to all shells (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure that you can run link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#getting-started[oc cluster up, window="_blank"] with no errors before moving on to the installation of AeroGear.
+
NOTE: Installation on macOS with Docker Machine has not been tested, use the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#macos-with-docker-for-mac[Docker for Mac] instructions when installing OpenShift.
+
* A link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] account
//** For Linux (RHEL), manage Docker as a non-root user. For more information, see section _Manage Docker as a non-root user_ in  link:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/[Post-installation steps for Linux].

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible, window="_blank"] (version 2.6 or above)

* For Linux (Fedora), add an extra port to the `dockerc` zone:

[source,sh]
----
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --zone dockerc --add-port 443/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --reload
----

* A local mobile development environment for the platform you want to develop on.

[[procedure]]
== Procedure

. Clone the Mobile-core installer:
+
The installer configures the local development installation of {org-name} {product-name} using ansible scripts in our link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core[mobile-core, window="_blank"] repo.
+
Clone this repo to your local machine and check out the {release-number} tag using:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core.git
cd mobile-core
git checkout {release-number}
----

. In the same directory, run the installer:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./installer/install.sh
----
+
The installer checks that valid versions of Ansible, Docker and the OpenShift Client Tools
are installed.

. Enter your Docker Hub login credentials when prompted. The installer checks these credentials are valid before continuing.

. Accept the default values for the next set of prompts, unless you have specific requirements and understand the implications of changing the values.
For more information about these values, see the _DockerHub, Cluster IP and Wildcard DNS Host values_ section in xref:additional-resources[Additional Resources].
+
NOTE: If your Cluster IP address is reported as 127.0.0.1, the installation will not succeed. Check your network connection and restart the installer.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
DockerHub Tag (Defaults to latest):
DockerHub Organisation (Defaults to aerogearcatalog):
Cluster IP (Defaults to < Network IP Address >)
Wildcard DNS Host (Defaults to nip.io):
----
+
For more information, see the _DockerHub, Cluster IP and Wildcard DNS Host values_ section in xref:additional-resources[Additional resources].
+
The following installation can take a while the first time it runs, as it pulls a number of Docker images. Once completed successfully, this results in an output similar to the following:
+
----
TASK [output-oc-cluster-status : debug] ******************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "Web console URL: https://192.168.37.1:8443/console/",

        "Volumes are at host directory /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes",
        "Persistent volumes are at host directory /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.pv",
        "Data is at host directory /path/to/mobile-core/ui/openshift-data"
    ]
}

----
+
The log above is displayed after a successful installation.

. Verify the installation:
+
.. Browse to the Web console URL displayed at the end of the installation, and log in, accepting the self-signed certificate if displayed.
+
The developer login credentials are:
+
----
username: developer
password: password
----

.. At the top of the catalog package, find the *Mobile* category that indicates that the mobile features of {org-name} {product-name} are successfully installed.

== Troubleshooting
Firewall issues can occur with external devices trying to communicate with {product-name} provisioned on a Linux machine.
This is due to a number of {product-name} using ports which are restricted to root users only. If you encounter these issues, you can add the ports to your firewall. Depending on the port your service uses, an example of the ports you may want to add to your firewall are:

NOTE: The following command will only add the specified port for the current session. If you reload your firewall or restart your machine the specified port will be restricted again.
----
$ firewall-cmd --add-port 443/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --add-port 80/tcp
----

== DockerHub, Cluster IP and Wildcard DNS Host values

Use *DockerHub Tag* and *DockerHub Organisation* to configure the location of the APBs used by the service-catalog in the cluster you are creating:
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
DockerHub Tag (Defaults to latest):
DockerHub Organisation (Defaults to aerogearcatalog):
----

The *Cluster IP* value defaults to the IP address of your primary network interface.
If you want to connect to your OpenShift instance from a mobile device, ensure that your device is on the same network.
Typically, you should ensure you are using the IP Address of your Wireless Adapter (if one exists):
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
Cluster IP (Defaults to < Network IP Address >)
----

The *Wildcard DNS Host* option alters the wildcard DNS host you want to use:
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
Wildcard DNS Host (Defaults to nip.io):
----
