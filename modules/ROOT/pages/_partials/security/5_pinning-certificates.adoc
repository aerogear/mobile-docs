link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning[Certificate pinning^] can be enabled in individual SDKs through the `mobile-services.json` file.
Certificate pinning will only be enabled for services which are used directly by the SDKs. For
other services *SPKI* pinning is used. Mobile services must have pinning configured
separately. For more information on setting up certificate pinning for mobile services see the
link:https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html#CertificatePinning[Android network security guide^].

== Generating Pinning Configuration

The {sdk} gets its configuration from the `https` section of the `mobile-services.json` file
in a project.

[source,json]
----
{
    "services":[],
    "https": {
        "certificatePins": [{
            "host": "example.sync.service",
            "certificateHash": "exampleHash"
        }]
    }
}
----

To include the `https` section in configuration when generating it using the Mobile CLI use the
`--include-cert-pins` flag when retrieving a client configuration. By default, self-signed or
invalid certs will not be permitted to be included in the certificate pinning configuration. To
allow these to be included use the `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./mobile get clientconfig <client name> --include-cert-pins --insecure-skip-tls-verify

=== Using Pinning Configuration

If the `https` section is included in the `mobile-services.json` file then certificate pinning will
automatically be enabled for mobile services.

[discrete]
=== Considerations

If the certificate authority of a service changes then the `mobile-services.json` file will need to
be regenerated in order to retrieve the correct `https` configuration. The app will then need to be
rebuilt and republished for the end users to consume. If this is not done then an app may become
incapable of making network requests to other services.
