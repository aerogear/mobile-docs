= Binding Mobile Services

In order to use services with a mobile app, the {mobile-client} associated with the app must be bound to services.
A service must be provisioned before it can be bound.

To view the services available to be bound to a {mobile-client} go to the *Mobile Services* tab in the {mobile-client}
view.

Once a service has been bound to a {mobile-client} the `mobile-services.json` for that client will be updated to
include the configuration for the service. This allows a mobile app to interact with the service.
The UI will also be updated to show the service is bound to the {mobile-client}.
