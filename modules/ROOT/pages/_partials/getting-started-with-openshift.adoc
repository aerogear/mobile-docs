= Getting Started with an OpenShift Project

After installing OpenShift with {product-name} using the procedure described in xref:getting-started.adoc#procedure[Setting Up], you can :

. Log into OpenShift using the following credentials:
+
User: developer
+
Password: <any value>
+
A project is automatically created for you, and typically you use that project to provision and configure everything you need to use mobile services.
+
When you start OpenShift for the first time, the mobile addon may require some time to complete and mobile services might not appear in the service catalog for a few minutes. 

. Shut down OpenShift:
+
[source,bash]
----
 oc cluster down
----

. Restart OpenShift:
+
[source,bash]
----
export CORE_LOC=$(pwd)
oc cluster up --host-data-dir=$CORE_LOC/ui/openshift-data --routing-suffix=<IP_ADDRESS>.nip.io --public-hostname=<IP_ADDRESS> --version=v3.9.0 --image=openshift/origin
