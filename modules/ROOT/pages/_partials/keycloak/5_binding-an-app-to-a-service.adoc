= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {keycloak-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

This section describes how to set up the {keycloak-service} service.
