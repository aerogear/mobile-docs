// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='doing-procedure-a']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
:context: {keycloak-service}
[id='monitoring-idm-{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Monitoring the {keycloak-service} Service

After the Mobile Metrics Service (includes Grafana for visualization and the Prometheus monitoring system) and {keycloak-service} Service are provisioned, "Keycloak Metrics" are displayed in the list of available dashboards.
Use Grafana’s exposed URL to monitor the {keycloak-service} Service.

.Prerequisites

* xref:getting-started-with-sso-{context}[Getting Started with Single Sign-On (SSO)].
* The {metrics-service} Service and {keycloak-service} Service must be provisioned in the same OpenShift project to access data.

.Procedure

. Navigate to Grafana’s exposed URL.
. Click Log in → Home
. Select *Keycloak Metrics*.

.. Dashboard panel descriptions
+
The Keycloak dashboard consists of several panels which give you an overview of the specific
events, such as the number of registered users, memory usage etc.
Below you will find a detailed description of each panel and its values.
+
.. Singlestat Panels
+
Singlestat panels show you the main summary of a single data series.
* *Total Registrations*: Total number of registered (non-admin) users. This number comprises all successful registrations made via various providers, e.g. Keycloak, Github, Facebook etc.
* *Total Logins*: Total number of successful logins (only non-admin users) over all providers.
* *Total Login Errors*: Total number of failed login attempts.
* *Current Memory*: The amount of memory currently used by the {keycloak-service} Service
+
.. Graph panels
+
Used to show how certain values change over time, e.g. the number of successful logins.
* *Logins*: Overview of the successful logins over time
* *Login Errors*: Overview of the failed login attempts over time
* *Memory Usage*: The values in this graph represents the following:
** *Used*: The amount of memory currently used by the {keycloak-service} Service
** *Commited*: The amount of memory that is guaranteed to be available for use (by JVM)
** *Max*: The maximum amount of memory that can be used for memory management
+
.. Pie Charts
+
Used to show the distribution of data, e.g. the number of logins per identity provider.
* *Logins Per Provider*: Overview of the successful (non-admin) user logins per provider
* *Registrations Per Provider*: Overview of the successful (non-admin) user registrations per provider.
