// Module included in the following assemblies:

// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='doing-procedure-a']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
:context: setting-up-idm
[id='doing-one-procedure-{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Setting Up IDM
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

This section describes how to set up the IDM Mobile Service.

NOTE: If prompted to *Create a Binding*, choose *Do not bind at this time*
+
When provisioning an {keycloak-service} service, you are prompted to set the following configuration:
+
* *Keycloak admin username*: Username for Keycloak administration
+
* *Keycloak admin password*: Password for the Keycloak admin user
+
* *Name of the Keycloak realm*: Name of the keycloak realm. (defaults to current namespace)
+
NOTE: A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.
+
* *Connect to an existing shared service*: Select if you want to use an existing service and you have the URL and credentials to use that service.
+
* *URL of the shared service*: Enter a value if you want to use an existing shared service.

Once the wizard steps are completed, navigate to the Project Overview in OpenShift to see the newly provisioned service.
Provisioning a service may take some time.
