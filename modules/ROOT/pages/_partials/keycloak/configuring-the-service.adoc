= Configuring the {keycloak-service} Service

This section guides you through configuring the redirect url and web origin for a client in {idm-name}.
This is required to enable OpenID authentication.
For an explanation of these terms, see link:{sso-docs-link}[{sso-name} Documentation].

.Prerequisites

* An understanding of link:https://openid.net/[OpenID, window="_blank"]

.Procedure

. Log into the {mobile-developer-console} and navigate to the {mobile-client} screen.

. Select the *Mobile Services* tab.

. If a binding to the {keycloak-service} service is in progress, a spinning icon is displayed to the right of the {keycloak-service} entry. Wait for the binding process to complete.

. If the _Keycloak Realm URL_ URL is not visible, expand the Identity Management Service by clicking the > icon.

. Click on the *Keycloak Realm URL* link to open the Keycloak Administration Console.

// TODO: @wei will default credentials always be as follows?
. Log in to the Administration console using the credentials you specified when xref:#provisioning[Provisioning] the service (defaults to admin/admin).

. Select `Clients` from the left navigation menu.

// TODO: with a cordova app, I didn't see mobile development platform
. Select your client from the list of clients. The name of your client is derived from the name of the {mobile-client}, the name of the mobile development platform and the client type, for example `myapp-android-public`.
