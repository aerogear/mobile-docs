= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {keycloak-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

This section describes how to set up the {keycloak-service} service.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {mobile-client}.

.Procedure

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Launch {mobile-developer-console}.

. Click on the {mobile-client} on the Overview screen.

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.

// end::excludeDownstream[]

NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console, however such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Click *Bind to App* for {keycloak-service}.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {keycloak-service} Service.
