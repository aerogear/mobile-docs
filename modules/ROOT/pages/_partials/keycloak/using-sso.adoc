// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Using SSO with the Device Browser

The {org-name} mobile SDK uses OpenID Connect link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow] to implement SSO using a mobile device browser.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed all steps in xref:adding-access-control-keycloak-service[Adding Access Control to your Mobile App].
* Two {mobile-client}s bound to the {keycloak-service} service.
* Two Mobile Apps built and running on the same device that are using the AeroGear SDK Auth module.

.Procedure

In the following procedure, the two apps are named **Email App** and **Messaging App**.
Substitute the appropriate names for your SSO scenario.

. Ensure the "Remember Me" option in {idm-name} is turned on. In the admin UI click on *Realm Settings* section on the left hand side, and then click on *Login*. Turn on *Remember Me*.

. Now that your two apps and {idm-name} clients are setup, sign into the *Email App* with the user you have previously created. You should be redirected to your device browser which should have loaded the {idm-name} login page.

. Next, enter in your credentials, make sure check the *Remember Me* option and login. You have now been authenticated on the *Email App* via the browser.

. Finally, try sign into the *Messaging App* and you should be automatically logged in as you have been previously authenticated in the *Email App* via the *_same_* browser.

.Additional resources

With iOS 11 and later, Apple has introduced SFAuthenticationSession for apps to perform SSO, instead of using the system Safari browser and there are known issues with this new feature.
Sometimes, the user may have to enter their credentials again, even if they have logged in previously in another app.
