// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='my-concept-module-a']
// * Title: = My concept module A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
:context: {keycloak-service}
[id='getting-started-with-sso-{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Getting Started with SSO
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

The Auth SDK uses OpenID Connect http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow] to achieve SSO via a mobile device browser.

Before getting started with SSO, ensure that:

* You have completed all steps in xref:adding-access-control-{keycloak-service}[Adding Access Control to your Mobile App].
* Two {mobile-client}s bound to the {keycloak-service} service.
* Two Mobile Apps built and running on the same device that are using the AeroGear SDK Auth module.
