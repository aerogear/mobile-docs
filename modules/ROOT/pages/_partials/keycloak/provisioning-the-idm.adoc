. Follow the wizard for provisioning that service.
+
NOTE: If prompted to *Create a Binding*, choose *Do not bind at this time*
+
When provisioning an {keycloak-service} service, you are prompted to set the following configuration:
+
* *{idm-name} admin username*: Username for {idm-name} administration
+
* *{idm-name} admin password*: Password for the {idm-name} admin user
+
* *Name of the {idm-name} realm*: Name of the {idm-name} realm. (defaults to current namespace)
+
NOTE: A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.
+
* *Connect to an existing shared service*: Select if you want to use an existing service and you have the URL and credentials to use that service.
+
* *URL of the shared service*: Enter a value if you want to use an existing shared service.

Once the wizard steps are completed, navigate to the Project Overview in OpenShift to see the newly provisioned service.
Provisioning a service may take some time.
