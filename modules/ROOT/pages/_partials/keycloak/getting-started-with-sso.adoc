= Getting Started with SSO

The Auth SDK uses OpenID Connect http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow] to achieve SSO via a mobile device browser.

Before getting started with SSO, ensure that:

* You have completed all steps in xref:adding-access-control-{keycloak-service}[Adding Access Control to your Mobile App].
* Two {mobile-client}s bound to the {keycloak-service} service.
* Two Mobile Apps built and running on the same device that are using the AeroGear SDK Auth module.
