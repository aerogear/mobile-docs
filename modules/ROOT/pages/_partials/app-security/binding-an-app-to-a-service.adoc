= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {app-security-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in the *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

This section describes how to set up the {app-security-service} service.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {mobile-client}.

.Procedure

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Launch {mobile-developer-console}.

. Click the {short-mobile-client} on the *Overview* screen.

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.

// end::excludeUpstream[]

// tag::excludeDownstream[]
image::mobile-clients-services-all-unbound.png[]
// end::excludeDownstream[]
+
NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console, however such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Click *Bind to App* for {app-security-service}.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {app-security-service} Service.


The {app-security-service} service will now be expandable, details about the service can be viewed.
