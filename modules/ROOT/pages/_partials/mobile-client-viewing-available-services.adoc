= Viewing Mobile Services

In order to use services with a mobile app, the {mobile-client} associated with the app must be bound to services. In
the list of {mobile-client}s in the *Overview* view there is a summary of the number of services available to be bound
to the {mobile-client} and how many services have already been bound to the client.

The *Mobile Services* tab in the {mobile-client} view shows the provisioned services that are available to be bound
to the {mobile-client}. If a service has not yet been bound to a {mobile-client}, a binding can be created by selecting
the *Create Binding* button.

If a service is bound to the {mobile-client} then details about the binding between the {mobile-client} and the
service can be seen when expanding the service. These details differ for each service.

Once a service has been bound to a {mobile-client}, the configuration for the {mobile-client} will be updated in the
*Overview* view and the {mobile-client} *Configuration* view. This configuration is used by your app to interact
with the bound services.
