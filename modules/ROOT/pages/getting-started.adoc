== Introduction

{org-name} {product-name} provides solutions to common development challenges faced by mobile developers.

// tag::excludeDownstream[]
With OpenShift's Container technology providing a secure, scalable backend platform, mobile developers can use the {org-name} SDK which supports a range of native (iOS & Android) and hybrid (Xamarin & Cordova) platforms to create secure, high quality apps and makes it easy to add features such as Push Notifications or Authentication.


{mobile-client}s in OpenShift allow you to perform Cloud Native Mobile App Development using OpenShift as the back-end for your mobile apps. A {mobile-client} is a representation of the mobile app that you are developing locally. {mobile-client}s allow you to bind your mobile app to mobile services such as {keycloak-service}, {unifiedpush-service}, {metrics-service} and others. This makes many of the common tasks associated with mobile development much easier and quicker to implement.

A configuration file named `mobile-services.json` acts as the link between your {mobile-client} in OpenShift and your local app in development. This configuration file is used to initialize the {SDK} in your mobile app and to connect to the back-end {product-name} you have provisioned on OpenShift.

IMPORTANT: {org-name} {product-name} is currently in a development phase. This makes it unsuitable for production deployment. Use this community release as an evaluation environment for developing and deploying mobile applications on Openshift.
