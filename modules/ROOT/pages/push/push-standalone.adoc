== Running the UnifiedPush Server on OpenShift

AeroGear provides a link:https://github.com/aerogearcatalog/unifiedpush-apb[Ansible Playbook Bundle] to make it easy to get running on OpenShift.
If you don't already have an account you can sign up link:https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html[here]. You can also use one of the various ways to run OpenShift on your own hardware like link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] or link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#getting-started[oc cluster up].
Alternatively you can follow the instructions in the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core[Mobile Application Platform] repo to get a local cluster running.

NOTE: When using the APB, authentication will be handled by OpenShift. KeyCloak is not required.

=== Add the AeroGear Unifiedpush APB to your Service Catalog

All AeroGear APBs are kept in the link:https://hub.docker.com/u/aerogearcatalog[AeroGear Catalog] organization on Docker Hub. This organization is not included by default in the Ansible Service Broker, but you can add it manually.
First you need to give your user account the permissions to access the Service Broker. Login as system admin and run:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user access-asb-role <your user>
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin <your user>
----

After that you should be able to open the `ansible-service-broker` project the OpenShift UI. Go to Resouces -> Config Maps. You should see one Config Map named `broker-config`.
Open it for editing and locate the registry section. Add another registry of the `dockerhub` type:

[source,yaml]
----
- type: "dockerhub"
  name: "ag"
  url: "https://registry.hub.docker.com"
  org: "aerogearcatalog"
  tag: "latest"
  white_list:
    - ".*-apb$"
----

Afterwards either restart the `asb` pod or, if you have the Ansible Playbook Bundle CLI tools installed, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ apb bootstrap
----

=== Create an instance using the Ansible Service Broker

Open the Service Catalog and you should see an entry for `AeroGear UnifiedPush Server`. Select it, pick a namespace to deploy it and a Wizard will guide you through the setup process.
