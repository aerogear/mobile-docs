== Privacy note

As explained in the xref:how_the_unifiedpush_server_works[How the UnifiedPush Server works] section, the payload of the push notification is delivered to 3rd party Push Network providers, like Google or Apple.

WARNING: It is highly recommended to not send any sensitive personal or confidential information belonging to an individual (e.g. a social security number, financial account or transactional information, or any information where the individual may have a reasonable expectation of secure transmission) as part of any Push Notification!

For analytic purposes on our link:#_dashboard[Dashboard] we store the content of the +alert+ key sent to the UnifiedPush Server. The content of the +alert+ key belongs to the metadata, which is deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the UnifiedPush Server.

== How the UnifiedPush Server Works

The {unifiedpush-service} service offers a unified Notification Service API to the above mentioned Push Network Services.
It can be seen as a _broker_ that distributes push messages to different 3rd party Push Networks.


NOTE: When using the UnifiedPush Server, please keep in mind that Push notification is a signalling mechanism and that it is not suitable to be used as a data carrying system (e.g. use in a chat application).
