=== Filtering recipients

It is possible to select a more specific set of recipients by adding additional values to *Variants*, *Alias*, *Device Types* and *Category*.
A {mobile-client} must be associated with one or more of these parameters in order for the filtering to work.
Set the additional values when you xref:ROOT:push/coding.adoc[Register a Device].
