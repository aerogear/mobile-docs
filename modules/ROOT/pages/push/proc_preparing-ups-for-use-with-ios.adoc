= Preparing {unifiedpush-service} For Use With iOS

Before using {unifiedpush-service} with iOS, first you need to submit a request for a new digital certificate, which is based on a public/private key. The Certificate itself is acting as the public key, and when you request it, a private key is added to your KeyChain tool. The Cerficate will be used later on, to request an SSL certificate for the Apple Push Network Service, which will allow the AeroGear Push Server to send notification messages to it.

19. On the overview of the *App ID*, click the _Edit_ button and scroll down to the Push Notifications section.

20. Now that both Certificates are generated, download both to your computer.

21. Double click the _aps_development.cer_ file (this is the _Development SSL Certificate_) and it displays in the *KeyChain Access* tool:
+

22. Export the certificate/private key pair to the *.p12* (_Personal Information Exchange_). Assign a passphrase for it.
+
NOTE: Ensure to store the _passphrase_ in a secure location.
+
NOTE: This file will be uploaded later on to the AeroGear Push Server enabling it to authorize itself for your development application on Apple Push Network Service and send messages to it.
+
