= Obtaining Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials

Before the Android application is able to receive the notifications, you must set up access to Firebase Cloud Messaging. As with iOS, you are only able to test out your push notifications in a real device. This section shows you how to obtain the credentials necessary to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for your app, including:

* the **Server key**
* the **Sender ID**
* the `google-services.json` file containing the credentials required to connect your app to Firebase and Google services.

== Project Setup and App Registration using the Firebase Console

First, register with the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) platform, formerly known as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). You need a Google Account to do this. Start by opening the https://console.firebase.google.com[Firebase Console].

1. If you haven't created a project, click **Create New Project**:

2. Now give your new project a name:

3. Once the project has been created you will be taken to the _Overview_ screen. From there click the Settings icon located next to the project name in the sidebar, and in the pop-up menu click **Project Settings**.

4. On the _Project Settings_ screen, switch to the _Cloud Messaging_ tab, where you can find the **Server key** and **Sender ID** (known in GCM as **Project Number**). There is also a _Legacy server key_ but it should not be used for new projects.

5. As the final step of the setup procedure, you need to download the `google-services.json` file. To do this, first navigate to the _Project Overview_ screen. If this is the first app in your project, click on `Add Firebase to my Android app` at the top of the page, otherwise click on **Add another App**. In the popup select _Add Firebase to your Android app_.
+
6. In the pop-up window enter the Package name of your app and then click the **Register app** button. In the next step you can download the `google-services.json` file. This file needs to be built into your app binary. Download the JSON file and save it. Click **Next** on the following screens. Skip the step to install the Firebase SDK. Google will send an initial push notification for verification but you can skip this step too if you don't have a running app yet.

TIP: To re-download the `google-services.json` file, navigate to the _Project Settings_ screen, then switch to the _General_ tab, choose the desired app under `Your Apps` and click the `google-services.json` download button.

At this point Firebase is ready to deliver your messages and you can continue setting up the UnifiedPush server.
