[[message-format]]
Message Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The message format is very simple: A generic JSON map is used to sent
messages to Android, iOS and Windows devices.

* `ttl` Specifies in seconds the `time-to-live` for the submitted
notification. This value is supported by APNs and GCM. If a device is
offline for a longer time than specified by the `ttl` value, the
supported Push Networks may not deliver the notification.
* `content-available` is an iOS specific argument to mark the payload as
'content-available'. The feature is needed when sending notifications to
Newsstand applications and submitting silent iOS notifications (iOS7)

[[message-object]]
Message Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The applications on the devices will receive the JSON map and are
responsible for performing a lookup to read values of the given keys.

[[ios-special-keys]]
iOS special keys
++++++++++++++++

If the JSON map contains one of the following reserved keywords, Apple
specific hooks will be invoked on the device:

* `alert` (triggers a dialog, displaying the value - no iOS API needs to
be invoked by the app developer)
* `sound` (plays a given sound - no iOS API needs to be invoked by the
app developer)
* `badge` (sets the value of the badge icon - no iOS API needs to be
invoked by the app developer)
* `content-available` (iOS7 feature for submitting silent iOS
notifications)
* `action-category` (iOS8 feature for interactive notifications)

[[android-special-keys]]
Android special keys
++++++++++++++++++++

None! The JSON map is submitted as it is, directly to the device. There
are no Android specific keywords.

[[cordova-android-special-keys]]
Cordova Android special keys
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make the user experience the same on iOS and Android, for cordova
users, we use the iOS alert 'key' on Android as well to generate a
notification for you. And we've introduced a 'title' that can optionally
be used for the title of this notification, if none is specified the
application name will be used like on iOS.


[[simplepush-object]]
SimplePush Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For SimplePush an extra `simple-push` object is provided. This key is
only used for SimplePush variants. The version is submitted to all
connected client, that are subscribed on their matching channels.

[[query-component]]
Query component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently the Server will support the following query criteria:

* `variants`: A list of one or more _mobile variant ID's_ to identify a
particular PushApplication variant (e.g. HR Android, HR iPad).
* `alias`: A list of one or more _identifiers_ (such as `email` or
`username`) to send messages to _ALL_ devices of the user(s). The
`alias` needs to be stored, when the device is registering itself with
the server.
* `categories`: Helps to _tag_ the current client with multiple
categories. Gives a semantic meaning to a registered `Installation`.
* `deviceType`: A list of raw device types that should receive the
message (e.g. Coupon only for iPad and AndroidTablets). The `deviceType`
needs to be stored when the device is registering itself with the
server.

_*NOTE:*_ All these query criterias are optional. If no criterias are
passed it will act as a _broadcast_ send, where _all_ clients are
notified.
