= Viewing Build Logs

== Viewing Build History in the OpenShift Console

All of the builds related to your mobile client can be seen in the **Builds** tab of your {mobile-client}. Each build can be expanded to show further information about the build configuration, latest build and build history.

All builds have a *View Log* link associated with them to access the detailed logs of that build.

. Navigate to the {mobile-client} and click the *Builds* tab.
