= Using the {unifiedpush-service} Mobile Service

The {unifiedpush-service} service allows you to send native push notifications to different mobile operating systems.

* Code once and push notifications to iOS and Android.
* Push notifications to defined groups.
* Push notifications to either iOS only or Android only.
* Push notifications to different variants of a mobile app.
* Push notifications from different back-end apps to the same mobile app.

The {unifiedpush-service} service offers a unified Notification Service API to the above mentioned Push Network Services.
It can be seen as a _broker_ that distributes push messages to different 3rd party Push Networks.

Currently the service supports:

* link:https://developer.apple.com/notifications/[Apple Push Notification Service, window="_blank"]
* link:https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/[Firebase Cloud Messaging, window="_blank"]

include::_partials/push/ref_terminology.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The payload of the push notification is delivered to 3rd party Push Network providers, like Google or Apple.

WARNING: It is highly recommended to not send any sensitive personal or confidential information belonging to an individual (e.g. a social security number, financial account or transactional information, or any information where the individual may have a reasonable expectation of secure transmission) as part of any Push Notification.

For analytic purposes on our link:#_dashboard[Dashboard] we store the content of the +alert+ key sent to the UnifiedPush Server.
The content of the +alert+ key belongs to the metadata, which is deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the UnifiedPush Server.
