= Self Defence Checks

As part of the Auth SDK module, there is a self defence check feature that will make sure that yor application is meeting the modern OWASP recommendations.  This feature offers multiple security checks that can be used to analyse the security of the device.  This can be useful for developers to detect vulnerablities and react accordingly.  For example, if the app detects security issue *X* then do *Y*, where *X* could be no lock screen is set and *Y* is show a system prompt to setup the lock screen.

This module offers:

1. A suite of self-defence checks to detect an insecure or hostile environment.
2. Ability to implement custom self-defence checks.
3. Interfaces to access the results of self-defence checks and take appropriate action in application code.
4. Integration with the AeroGear Services Metrics SDK to report self-defence checks data.

== Perquisites

. Import and initialise the Auth SDK module - link:auth.adoc[AeroGear Services Auth SDK].

== Usage

To begin using self defence checks in your app, you'll need to retrieve an instance of link:javadoc[`SecurityService`]. The `SecurityService` can be retrieved using the link:javadoc[`MobileCore#getInstance`] method.

[source, java]
----
SecurityService securityService = MobileCore.getInstance(SecurityService.class);
----

Any subsequent `MobileCore#getInstance` method will return the same instance of `SecurityService`. +
There are two ways to implement self defence checks: <<Provided Self Defence Checks>> and <<Custom Self Defence Checks>>.

== Provided Self Defence Checks

These are self defence checks provided by the SDK in link:javadoc[`SecurityCheckType`].

A successful Check means that the environment the application is running in is more secure and no action is required, as opposed to signalling if a certain feature is enabled.

For example, the Root Access Detection Check `NOT_ROOTED` should return `true` when it is *not* rooted, since this would be the more secure condition.

=== Root Access Detection (NOT_ROOTED)

To help prevent your app running in a device that has been rooted/jailbroken the `SecurityCheckType#NOT_ROOTED` function can be used.  This function uses the link:https://github.com/scottyab/rootbeer[Rootbeer] library to check if root access is present on the device.

=== Developer Mode Detection (NO_DEVELOPER_MODE)

To detect if Developer Mode has been enabled on the device the `SecurityCheckType#NO_DEVELOPER_MODE` function can be used.  This function uses Android's link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html[Settings] class.

=== Debugger Detection (NO_DEBUGGER)

To detect if an Android debugger is attached to the app the `SecurityCheckType#NO_DEBUGGER` function can be used.  This function uses Android's link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.html[Debug] class.

=== Emulator Detection (NOT_IN_EMULATOR)

To detect if the app is being run on an emulator the `SecurityCheckType#NOT_IN_EMULATOR` function can be used.  This function uses Android's link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html[Build] class.

=== Device Lock Detection (SCREEN_LOCK_ENABLED)

To detect if a device has a lock screen set (with pin, fingerprint, pattern) the `SecurityCheckType#SCREEN_LOCK_ENABLED` function can be used.  This function uses Android's link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager.html[KeyguardManager] class.

=== App Data Backup Detection (ALLOW_BACKUP_DISABLED)

To detect whether the application's data is configured to be synchronized across devices the `SecurityCheckType#ALLOW_BACKUP_DISABLED` function can be used. The link:https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html[allowBackup] flag determines whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and restore infrastructure, which might be interesting to avoid depending on your app's needs.

=== Device Encryption Detection (HAS_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED)

To detect whether the devices filesystem is encrypted the `SecurityCheckType#HAS_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED` function can be used. This function uses Android's link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html[DevicePolicyManager] class.

== Custom Self Defence Checks

These are self defence checks that you can define to be used by the SDK. Custom self defence checks must extend the link:javadoc[`AbstractSecurityCheck`] interface.

[source, java]
----
class CustomSecurityCheck extends AbstractSecurityCheck {
    /**
     * Custom security check.
     *
     * @param context Context to be used by the check.
     * @return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>
     */
    @Override
    protected boolean execute(@NonNull final Context context) {
        // implement security check in customSecurityCheck()
        boolean result = customSecurityCheck();
        return result;
    }
}
----

=== Invoking a Single Self Defence Check
The `SecurityService#check` method can be used to run a single self defence check.  It expects either `SecurityCheckType` (see <<Provided Self Defence Checks
>>)  or `SecurityCheck` (see <<Custom Self Defence Checks
>>) as a parameter and returns link:javadoc[`SecurityCheckResult`].

[source, java]
----
// a provided self defence check
SecurityCheckResult result = securityService.check(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>);

// using the custom self defence check defined previously
SecurityCheck customSecurityCheck = new CustomSecurityCheck();
SecurityCheckResult result = securityService.check(customSecurityCheck);
----

=== Invoking Multiple Self Defence Checks

To invoke multiple self defence checks a security check executor must be used.  There are two types of security check executors: link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`], where self defence checks are executd synchronously, and link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`], where self defence checks are executd asynchronously.

==== Synchronously

To run multiple self defence checks _synchronously_, you'll first need to invoke the link:javadoc[`SecurityService#getCheckExecutor`] method.  This methods returns link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] where checks can be added (chained) to the executor and executed synchronously.


[source, java]
----
SyncSecurityCheckExecutor syncCheckExecutor = securityService.getCheckExecutor();
----

==== Asynchronously

To run multiple self defence checks _asynchronously_, youâ€™ll first need to invoke the link:javadoc[`SecurityService#getAsyncCheckExecutor`] method. This methods returns link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] where checks can be added (chained) to the executor and executed asynchronously.

[source, java]
----
AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor asyncCheckExecutor = securityService.getAsyncCheckExecutor();
----

==== Adding Checks to Self Defence Check Executors

Both the link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] and link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] have an `addCheck` method.  This method expects either link:javadoc[`SecurityCheckType`]  or link:javadoc[`SecurityCheck`] as a paramater. +

If you are invoking the `addCheck` method on a link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] then it will return link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`]. +

If you are invoking the `addCheck` method on an link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] then it will return link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`].

[source, java]
----
// adding self defence checks to a SyncSecurityCheckExecutor

// add two provided self defence checks to the syncCheckExecutor
syncCheckExecutor.addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>).addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>);
// add the CustomSecurityCheck to the syncCheckExecutor
syncCheckExecutor.addCheck(new customSecurityCheck());


// adding self defence checks to a AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor

// add two provided self defence checks to the asyncCheckExecutor
asyncCheckExecutor.addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>).addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>);
// add the CustomSecurityCheck to the asyncCheckExecutor
asyncCheckExecutor.addCheck(new customSecurityCheck());
----

==== Executing Self Defence Checks on Executors

Both link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] and link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] have an `execute` method that executes all self defence checks that have been added. +

The `execute` method for link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] returns a `Map` where the key is the name of the self defence check being tested (`String`) and the value is  link:javadoc[`SecurityCheckResult`]. +

The `execute` method for link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] returns a `Map` where the key is the result of the `getName` method on the `SecurityCheck` instance being tested and the value is a `Map` of type `Future` with link:javadoc[`SecurityCheckResult`].

[source, java]
----
// execute self defence checks on the syncCheckExecutor
Map<String, SecurityCheckResult> results = syncCheckExecutor.execute();

// execute self defence checks on the asyncCheckExecutor
Map<String, Future<SecurityCheckResult>> results = asyncCheckExecutor.execute();
----

Both link:javadoc[`SyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] and link:javadoc[`AsyncSecurityCheckExecutor`] allow for multiple checks to be chained so the above examples can be refactored to:

[source, java]
----
// adding self defence checks and executing these checks synchronously
Map<String, SecurityCheckResult> results = securityService.getCheckExecutor().addCheck(new customSecurityCheck()).addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>).addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>).execute();

// adding self defence checks and executing these checks asynchronously
Map<String, Future<SecurityCheckResult> results = securityService.getAsyncCheckExecutor().addCheck(new customSecurityCheck()).addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>).addCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>).execute();
----

=== Reporting Self Defence Checks Results Via the Metrics Service

In order to report the results of Self Defence utilize the link:./metrics[Metrics] service in conjunction with the link:javadoc[SecurityService].

Individual checks can be reported via the `checkAndSendMetric` method:

[source, java]
----
MetricsService metricsService = mobileCore.getInstance(MetricsService.class);
SecurityService securityService = activity.mobileCore.getInstance(SecurityService.class);
SecurityCheckResult result = securityService.checkAndSendMetric(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>, metricsService);
----

Reporting the results for multiple checks can be done via an `Executor` that is passed a reference to the `MetricsService`:

[source, java]
----
MetricsService metricsService = mobileCore.getInstance(MetricsService.class);
Map<String, SecurityCheckResult> results = SecurityCheckExecutor.Builder.newSyncExecutor(this.getContext())
    .withSecurityCheck(SecurityCheckType.<check_type>)
    // other checks...
    .withMetricsService(metricsService)
    .build().execute();
----
