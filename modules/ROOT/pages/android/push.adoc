= AeroGear Service Push SDK

AeroGear for Android provides support for integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with the AeroGear Unified Push Server.

Push messaging is a mechanism for sending data to mobile clients from a remote server. For mobile applications, this reduces battery usage, removes polling code and provides for a better user experience as data changes are communicated in real time.

Messages that FCM receives from an application server are sent to the Android device over a connection managed by the operating system. These messages are then extracted and passed to an application using services definied provided by the AeroGear library.

== Adding dependency

Add the push dependency to your application module

[source,groovy]
----
implementation "org.aerogear:aerogear-push:[version]"
implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:[version]"
----

== Firebase setup

In order to receive push messages you need to setup the Firebase in your project. 

1. Create a new project in link:https://console.firebase.google.com[Firebase console]
2. Add link:https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin[The Google Services Gradle Plugin] in your root `build.gradle` file
[source,groovy]
  buildscript {   
      dependencies {
          classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:[version]'
      }
  } 
3. Apply the plugin in your app `build.gradle` file
[source,groovy]
  // ADD THIS AT THE BOTTOM
  apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
4. Download the `google-services.json` from link:https://console.firebase.google.com[Firebase console] and drop it into your app folder

See the complete guide in the link:https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup[Firebase website]

== AeroGear Configuration file

A `mobile-services.json` file must exist in the apps assets directory. It should specify configuration
for link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/[Unified Push Server]. This configuration can be generated by the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli[AeroGear Mobile CLI].

For an example of push configuration see link:../../example/src/main/assets/mobile-services.json[example apps mobile-services.json].

== Registering with Unified Push Server

This example demonstrates how to register a device to provide the values required to register the application with FCM and Unified Push and perform the registration.

=== Getting PushService

[source,java]
----
PushService pushService = new PushService.Builder().openshift().build();
----

=== Registering the device

[source,java]
----
pushService.registerDevice()
  .requestOn(new AppExecutors().mainThread())
  .respondWith(new Responder<Boolean>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(Boolean value) { // Yay }

    @Override
    public void onException(Exception exception) { // Oops! }
});

----

You also can add some optional parameters using `UnifiedPushConfig`

[source,java]
----
UnifiedPushConfig unifiedPushConfig = new UnifiedPushConfig();
unifiedPushConfig.setAlias("AeroGear");
unifiedPushConfig.setCategories(Arrays.asList("Android", "OpenShift"));

pushService.registerDevice(unifiedPushConfig)
  .requestOn(new AppExecutors().mainThread())
  .respondWith(new Responder<Boolean>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(Boolean value) { // Yay }

    @Override
    public void onException(Exception exception) { // Oops! }
});
----

=== Unregistering the device

If you want to add option for user to stop receiving notifications.

[source,java]
----
pushService.unregisterDevice()
  .requestOn(new AppExecutors().mainThread())
  .respondWith(new Responder<Boolean>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(Boolean value) { // Yay }

    @Override
    public void onException(Exception exception) { // Oops! }
});
----

== Handling messages

`MessageHandler` is responsible for handling the messages received from FCM. It will give you total flexibility to decide what to do with the message recieved.

== Receiving Background and Foreground Messages

Currently, push messages are received by an instance of  `AeroGearFirebaseMessagingService`. The messages are processed and passed to `PushService.notifyHandlers`.

Classes which implement `MessageHandler` can ask that their methods be called on either the UI thread using `PushService.registerMainThreadHandler` or on a background thread using `PushService.registerBackgroundThreadHandler`. UI threads are most useful for Activities and Fragments; background threads are most useful for everything else.

In an Activity (or in a Fragment) you must remove the handler when the Activity goes into the background and must reenable it when it comes into the foreground.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    PushService.registerMainThreadHandler(this);
    PushService.unregisterBackgroundThreadHandler(myBackgrondHandlerInstance);
}

@Override
public void onStop() {
    super.onStop();
    PushService.unregisterMainThreadHandler(this);
    PushService.registerBackgroundThreadHandler(myBackgrondHandlerInstance);
}
----

== Default handler

Unfortunately when you close or kill the app the Android system can destroy the `PushService` instance and we will lose the handler you have added there. To solve this we provide a way to register a default handler, it will be used when app is not running (actually running in background) and there are no others handlers registered.

_AndroidManifest.xml_
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="DEFAULT_MESSAGE_HANDLER_KEY"
            android:value="package.ClassName" />
    </application>
</manifest>
