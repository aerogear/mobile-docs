= {mobile-client}s in OpenShift

A {mobile-client} is a **representation** of your mobile application (Android, iOS, Cordova) in OpenShift. It allows your mobile application to use the Aerogear SDKs to integrate with the following:

* Aerogear Services running in OpenShift.
* Your own backend services running in OpenShift.
* External web services available on the internet.

== mobile-services.json

The {mobile-client} provides all of the configuration needed by a mobile application using the Aerogear SDKs. This configuration is known as `mobile-services.json`.

The `mobile-services.json` file is generated in the OpenShift web console and is consumed by the various Aerogear SDKs, allowing your application to access the web services it needs.
