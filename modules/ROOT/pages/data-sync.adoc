Unlike other mobile services which provide a server and an API, Data Sync is a framework that you use to develop services. Typically, you develop a {sync-service} service as follows:

. Design a link:https://graphql.org/learn[GraphQL] schema.
. Develop a server side service.
. Containerize your server and deploy it to OpenShift as a Data Sync App.
. Bind your mobile app to that data sync server app.
. Configure your mobile app to point to the data sync server app.
. Complete your mobile app development.
. Build and run your mobile app.
