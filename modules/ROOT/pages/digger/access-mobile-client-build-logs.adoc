= Viewing Build Logs

== Viewing Build History in the OpenShift Console

All of the builds related to your mobile client can be seen in the **Builds** tab of your {mobile-client}. Each build can be expanded to show further information about the build configuration, latest build and build history.

The latest build, as well as previous builds, has a `View Log` link associated with them to access the detailed logs of that build.

== Viewing Build Logs in Jenkins

. Click the `View Log` link for the build you want to view logs, you are redirected to the Jenkins instance that has been running your build.

. If prompted, log into Openshift and accept the authorization request for:
+
* user:info permission
* user:check-access permission

. View the log of the build. Based on your permissions to the Openshift project, you might have access to other Jenkins capabilities, such as inspecting the build configuration or re-running the build with changes in the pipeline script.
