= Creating a Build Configuration

== Prerequisites

* [x] xref:digger/provisioning.adoc[Provision {digger-service}].
* [x] A mobile client, either xref:android/index.adoc[Android], xref:cordova/index.adoc[Cordova], xref:xamarin/index.adoc[xamarin] or xref:ios/index.adoc[ios].

== Creating the Build

You can create a new client build for an existing mobile client via the OpenShift UI by locating the mobile client you want to create a build for in the project overview screen. Then:

** Clicking the name of this client to open the mobile client details view.

** At the top right is a drop down button with a set of actions. One of these actions will be Create Build, this will open a new client build form.

** Give the new build a unique name

== Source Configuration

In order to build your application, source configuration needs to be supplied to provide information about where the application source is and how it can be accessed.

=== Repository

** Add Git Repository URL. To provide additional advanced information such as a different git ref (default is master), or Jenkinsfile path (default is the root of the repo), use the advanced options.
** Add Authentication Type:
*** Public: Use this for public repos that require no authentication.
*** Basic Authentication: Username/password credentials, use this for https/http repo urls that require authentication.
*** SSH Key: SSH Private Key Authentication, use this for ssh repo urls (git@).

When adding credentials to access private repositories (Basic Authentication and SSH Key), a unique name should be supplied.

=== Advanced Options

Selecting the "advanced options" in the source configuration section displays a number of additional options:
Git Reference:: Optional branch, tag, or commit to checkout, default is master. This option can be used to select different branches of you application repo for different builds e.g. release vs develop
Jenkins file path:: Optional path to where the Jenkinsfile is located in your application repo, default is the root of the repo.

== Build Configuration

Add configuration relating to the type of build being created e.g debug or release. The type of information required here will depend on the type of application being built.

=== Android
Add Build Type:
Debug:: An Android debug build, no additional information required
Release:: An Android release build, requires an upload of a password protected PKCS12 file containing a key protected by the same password.

==== Release Build Type

As a release build will need to be signed, you need to specify the keystore and private key passwords.

==== Keystore located in source code

If your keystore is checked into your source code, you will need to take the password value in your build script as an environmental variable. This will allow you to set this environmental variable as part of your client build from within the OpenShift UI. This can be done directly when creating the mobile client build or afterwards by editing the build config.

==== External keystore

If you have an external keystore, you should ensure to select the checkbox to use an external keystore once this is done, you will be asked for the following additional information:

Name:: A unique name for the android credentials you are adding e.g. my-android-release-cert
Android KeyStore:: Password protected PKCS12 file containing a key protected by the same password. 

The PKSC12 archive of your android keystore certificate can be generated using the following command:
[source,bash]
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <your-android-cert.keystore> -destkeystore <your-android-cert>.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcalias <your-android-cert-alias>


KeyStore Password:: The password for the android keystore and the PKCS12 archive (The password for the archive and the keystore must be the same)
KeyStore Alias:: The entry name of the private key/certificate chain you want to use to sign your APK(s). This entry must exist in the key store uploaded. If your key store contains only one key entry, which is the most common case, you can leave this field blank.

=== iOS
Build Type:: Build type value to be used by xcodebuild
Name:: The unique credential name to be used in jenkins
Apple Developer Profile:: An xcode zip generated file that contains all required files (certificate, private key and provisioning profile) to sign an iOS app. For more information, see this documentation on exporting developer accounts in XCode.
Apple Developer Profile Password:: The developer profile password to be used by jenkins when importing the developer profiles private key.

=== Cordova
Platform:: The platform that the app will target.
Build Type:: The build type value (debug or release). Depending on the platform selected, this may result in additional parameters to be required.
** For Android, see the Android build configuration section.
** For iOS, see the iOS build configuration section.
