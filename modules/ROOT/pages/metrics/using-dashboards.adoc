= Using dashboards to display metrics service data

== Prerequisites

[x] A provisioned {metrics-service} as described in xref:metrics/provisioning.adoc[Provisioning {metrics-service} Service]

== Overview of dashboards

The metrics service uses https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] to gather metrics data from other mobile services and https://grafana.com/[Grafana] to display that data.

A Grafana dashboard allows you to arrange panels and charts together to provide a visual overview of your metrics. 
See the Grafana http://docs.grafana.org/guides/getting_started/[Getting Started] guide for an introduction to dashboards.

When you create an instance of an AeroGear service from the OpenShift service catalog, a dashboard that shows metrics about that service is added to Grafana. You can also create and modify custom dashboards to:

* visualize metrics from apps and backend services that are not mobile services
* monitor additional metrics from mobile services that are not displayed by default
* monitor additional metrics from OpenShift that are not displayed by default

== Creating dashboards in Grafana

You can create dashboards using *Drag and Drop* in Grafana. 
See the http://docs.grafana.org/[Grafana Documentation] to learn about building Grafana dashboards. 

== Importing dashboards

All Grafana dashboards are represented by a JSON definition. Dashboards can be imported and exported using that JSON definition as described in the link:http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/[importing and exporting dashboards] Grafana documentation.

== Customizing the mobile services dashboards

When you provision a mobile service from the service catalog, a dashboard showing metrics about that service is added to Grafana.

NOTE: If you edit the default mobile service dashboards, your changes will be lost whenever the associated mobile service is updated.

Before editing the dashboard, clone it as follows:

. Open the Dashboard you want to clone.
. Click the settings icon in the dashboard controls to show the *Settings* screen.
. Select the *Save As* option and enter in a name for the new dashboard, for example `Copy of Sync Service Dashboard`.
