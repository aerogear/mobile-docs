== Overview

After the Metrics service (includes Grafana tool and Prometheus monitoring system) is provisioned, 
you should be able to see the "Mobile Services" in the list of available dashboards 
(navigate to Grafana's exposed URL -> Log in -> Home -> Select *Mobile Services*)

The dashboard contains rows with panels, each row for a different service. 
See the description below for more information about each service's panels.


== 1. Keycloak

=== Keycloak service description

This panel just gives you basic information about the Keycloak service

=== Provisioned

This panel informs you about the status of connection with the Keycloak service.

If you want the Keycloak service's metrics data to be available for Grafana, you first need to deploy it
from the Service Catalog: https://github.com/aerogearcatalog/keycloak-apb

*Note:* Keycloak service must be provisioned within the same namespace,
otherwise the Keycloak's metrics endpoint won't be reachable for Prometheus and no data will be displayed.
