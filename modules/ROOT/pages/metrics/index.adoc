= Introduction To Metrics

The metrics service provides monitoring and metrics for provisioned mobile services.
The service consists of Prometheus and Grafana with an OAuth Proxy tied to openshift permissions, for authentication and authorization.
It automates the gathering and display of service metrics by using features in Openshift, annotations and configMaps, to allow the discovery of service metrics and visualization of data.
The metrics service makes it easy to monitor provisioned mobile services and custom services in your project.
