* [x] You have setup the showcase app locally as described in xref:showcase-apps/service-setup.adoc[Service Setup].

You should be able see app and device data in Grafana.

Also, when you perform xref:showcase-apps/device-security.adoc[device security] checks, metrics are also sent and available
for inspection on Grafana.
