= Getting Started with {org-name} {product-name}

== Introduction

{org-name} {product-name} provides solutions to common development challenges faced by mobile developers.
With OpenShift's Container technology providing a secure, scalable backend platform, mobile developers can use the {org-name} SDK which supports a range of native (iOS & Android) and hybrid (Xamarin & Cordova) platforms to create secure, high quality apps and makes it easy to add features such as Push Notifications or Authentication.

IMPORTANT: {org-name} {product-name} is currently in a development phase. This makes it unsuitable for production deployment. Use this community release as an evaluation environment for developing and deploying mobile applications on Openshift.


This guide shows you how to:

* Set up {org-name} {product-name} on OpenShift
* Create a {mobile-client} and a Mobile Service ({keycloak-service})
* Set up a local development environment
* Configure the {org-name} showcase app for your mobile platform (Android, iOS, Cordova or Xamarin).
* Run the showcase app and make calls to the {keycloak-service} service.

Make sure you satisfy all the requirements listed in the xref:prerequisites[] and that you have a mobile app development environment configured. Some experience with OpenShift administration would also be helpful.

// start installing-mobile-services.adoc[leveloffset=1]
:leveloffset: 1



= Setting up {org-name} {product-name} on OpenShift

To use {product-name}, you must run OpenShift and install an add-on which enables {product-name}. For more information about OpenShift, see link:https://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift website, window="_blank"].

NOTE: {org-name} recommends running OpenShift using the method described in this document. However, there are many ways to run OpenShift, and {product-name} is compatible with most of these methods. There is a known issue with Minishift that makes it unsuitable for mobile development. This issue is described in link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/1287[Issue 1287, window="_blank"].

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* MacOS or Linux
+
NOTE: Due to an link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/18747[OpenShift bug], {product-name} will not run on RHEL/CentOS 7.4 or RHEL/CentOS 7.5.

* A system running OpenShift `oc cluster up` as described in link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#prerequisites[Local Cluster Management, window="_blank"]
+
NOTE: Installation on macOS with Docker Machine has not been tested, use the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#macos-with-docker-for-mac[Docker for Mac] instructions when installing OpenShift.
+
** Use link:https://www.openshift.org/download.html[OpenShift client tools, window="_blank"] version 3.9
+
IMPORTANT: OpenShift oc executable must be located in a system location that is known to all shells (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure that you can run link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#getting-started[oc cluster up, window="_blank"] with no errors before moving on to the installation of AeroGear.
+
* Access to a link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] account. The installer uses Docker Hub as a source for AeroGear Docker images.
//** For Linux (RHEL), manage Docker as a non-root user. For more information, see section _Manage Docker as a non-root user_ in  link:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/[Post-installation steps for Linux].

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible, window="_blank"] (version 2.6 or above)

* For Linux (Fedora), add an extra port to the `dockerc` zone:

[source,sh]
----
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --zone dockerc --add-port 443/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --reload
----

* A local mobile development environment for the platform you want to develop on.

[[procedure]]
== Procedure

. Clone the Mobile-core installer:
+
The installer configures the local development installation of {org-name} {product-name} using ansible scripts in our link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core[mobile-core, window="_blank"] repo.
+
Clone this repo to your local machine and check out the {release-number} tag using:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core.git
cd mobile-core
git checkout {release-number}
----

. In the same directory, run the installer:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./installer/install.sh
----
+
The installer checks that valid versions of Ansible, Docker and the OpenShift Client Tools
are installed.

. Enter your Docker Hub login credentials when prompted. The installer checks these credentials are valid before continuing.

. Accept the default values for the next set of prompts, unless you have specific requirements and understand the implications of changing the values.
For more information about these values, see the _DockerHub, Cluster IP and Wildcard DNS Host values_ section in xref:additional-resources[Additional Resources].
+
NOTE: If your Cluster IP address is reported as 127.0.0.1, the installation will not succeed. Check your network connection and restart the installer.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
DockerHub Tag (Defaults to latest):
DockerHub Organisation (Defaults to aerogearcatalog):
Cluster IP (Defaults to < Network IP Address >)
Wildcard DNS Host (Defaults to nip.io):
----
+
For more information, see the _DockerHub, Cluster IP and Wildcard DNS Host values_ section in xref:additional-resources[Additional resources].
+
The following installation can take a while the first time it runs, as it pulls a number of Docker images. Once completed successfully, this results in an output similar to the following:
+
----
TASK [output-oc-cluster-status : debug] ******************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [

The log above is displayed after a successful installation.

. Verify the installation:
+
.. Browse to the Web console URL displayed at the end of the installation, and log in, accepting the self-signed certificate if displayed.
+
The developer login credentials are:
+
----
username: developer
password: password
----
+
The service catalog is displayed

.. Check that the _Mobile_ tab is displayed in the service catalog. If this tab is not displayed, wait a few minutes to make sure that the installation process has completed. If the _Mobile_ tab still is not displayed, follow the troubleshooting steps below.

= Additional resources

== Troubleshooting
If you have problems running {org-name} {product-name}, run the installer using the `--debug` option to capture as much information as possible:
----
$ ./installer/install.sh --debug
----

Firewall issues can occur with external devices trying to communicate with {product-name} provisioned on a Linux machine.

This is due to a number of {product-name} using ports which are restricted to root users only. If you encounter these issues, you can add the ports to your firewall. Depending on the port your service uses an example of the ports you may want to add to your firewall are:

NOTE: The following command will only add the specified port for the current session. If you reload your firewall or restart your machine the specified port will be restricted again.
----
$ firewall-cmd --add-port 443/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --add-port 80/tcp
----

== DockerHub, Cluster IP and Wildcard DNS Host values

Use *DockerHub Tag* and *DockerHub Organisation* to configure the location of the APBs used by the service-catalog in the cluster you are creating:
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
DockerHub Tag (Defaults to latest):
DockerHub Organisation (Defaults to aerogearcatalog):
----

The *Cluster IP* value defaults to the IP address of your primary network interface.
If you want to connect to your OpenShift instance from a mobile device, ensure that your device is on the same network.
Typically, you should ensure you are using the IP Address of your Wireless Adapter (if one exists):
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
Cluster IP (Defaults to < Network IP Address >)
----

The *Wildcard DNS Host* option alters the wildcard DNS host you want to use:
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----

= Registering a {mobile-client}

After the setup is completed, the next thing you need to do is to register a {mobile-client} for the mobile app that you are going to develop.

A Mobile Client in OpenShift is a representation of the mobile app that you are developing locally. Mobile Clients allow you to bind your mobile app to mobile services such as Identity Management, Push Notification, Mobile Metrics and others. This makes many of the common tasks associated with mobile development much easier and quicker to implement. For more information, please see xref:mobile-clients.adoc[Mobile Clients in OpenShift]

[discrete]
== Procedure

To create a {mobile-client-openshift}:

. Log into the OpenShift console.
. Choose your project.
. Click *Add to Project* and choose *Browse Catalog* from the options.
+
You can filter the catalog items to only show mobile specific items by clicking the *Mobile* tab.
+
image:catalog-all.png[Available Mobile Clients]
. Click the *Apps* tab and then choose the mobile platform (Android, iOS, Cordova or Xamarin) and follow the wizard.
+
NOTE: On the wizard's *configuration* screen, it is recommended that you input the name of the showcase application into the *Package Name* text box.
+
NOTE: When registering an iOS app, you are prompted for a bundle id. See the link:https://cocoacasts.com/what-are-app-ids-and-bundle-identifiers/[description of bundle identifiers] for more information.

After the {mobile-client} is provisioned, you can navigate to it from Project Overview. The {mobile-client} view displays a list of mobile services that you can associate with the {mobile-client}, and offers to provision any mobile service that is in the service catalog but is not currently provisioned.

= Binding a {mobile-client}


To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in OpenShift using a {mobile-client}, and that {mobile-client} must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

== Procedure


. Navigate to the *Overview* of your OpenShift project.

. Select the {mobile-client} name listed in the {mobile-client}s section.

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.
+
image::mobile-clients-services-all-unbound.png[]

. Click *Create Binding* and follow the *Create Binding* wizard to associate the {mobile-client} with the {service-name} Service.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
+
NOTE: Use `public` when binding a {mobile-client} to a {service-name}. When binding mobile services to each other, use `bearer`.

The {service-name} service will now be expandable, details about the service can be viewed.

//[[using-self-signed-certificates-in-mobile-clients]]
= Using Self-Signed Certificates in Mobile Apps

NOTE: Before you can run a mobile app and connect to {product-name}, you must configure self-signed certificates on the mobile device.

Throughout the development lifecycle of a mobile app, a common
requirement is to integrate and connect with back-end
services in a secure manner. This is achieved using SSL/TLS.

However, in order for the client device to connect over SSL/TLS, it needs to trust the
certificates used by the back-end services, which are signed by a certificate authority.
Most client devices have a list of well-known and trusted certificate authorities pre-installed and this allows the client devices to verify the certificates used by the back-end services.

However, this normally doesn't work in a development environment, such as a local OpenShift cluster as it uses self-signed certificates which are not signed by any of the trusted certificate authorties. This means by default the client devices won't be able to establish secure connections with the back-end services that are running on a local OpenShift cluster.

To work around the problem, you must manually extract the root certificate from the cluster, install it on the device and mark it as trusted.

[[extracting-root-ca]]
== 1. Extracting the OpenShift Root Certificate Authority Cert

.. Log into OpenShift as the admin user:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
----

.. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get secret router-certs --template='{{index .data "tls.crt"}}' -n default  |  \
base64 --decode | sed -e '1,/^-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----$/ d'  > /tmp/localcluster.crt
----

****
.. https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819522?hl=en[Set screen lock] on the mobile device to ensure the certificate can be installed.

.. Copy the file to your device using one of the following methods:
+
* Email attachment (Recommended) - Simply email the certificate to an address
accessible from the device and download the attachment.
* Cloud service - Use a cloud storage service such as Dropbox or Google
Drive which is accessible from the device, browse to the certificate and
proceed to download it.
* USB - Attach the device to the machine hosting
OpenShift via USB and drag the certificate to a devices file system. Here is an https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2840804?hl=en[example guide for Google Nexus devices]. It may be different for other devices.
* link:https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb[Android Debug Bridge, window="_blank"] (adb) - Use the adb push command to push the certificate to device or emulator:

----
$ adb push /tmp/localcluster.crt /sdcard/Download/localcluster.crt
----
.. Add the certificate to your device:
+
If you are using the email or cloud service approach, once the certificate file is downloaded, you will be prompted by the Android system automatically to install the file. You can simply follow the instructions to complete the process.
+
However, if you are using the USB approach, you will need to install the certificate manually: go to Settings > Security > Install from storage, tap on the copied certificate file and Android system should detect the
certificate and let you add it to the device. Here is https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2844832?hl=en[a sample guide for Google Nexus devices].
