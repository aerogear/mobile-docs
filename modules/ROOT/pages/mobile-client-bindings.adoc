= Binding {mobile-client}s to Services in OpenShift

{mobile-client}s in OpenShift may be bound to particular services provisioned in the namespace to allow communication between them. 
The result of an binding produces a JSON configuration file (`mobile-services.json`) for your application which may be consumed by the Aerogear SDKs, allowing it to access the service (or services) it needs.

== Create a {mobile-client}
A {mobile-client} is a representation of your mobile application (Android, iOS, Cordova) in OpenShift. See link:./mobile-clients-in-openshift.adoc[this document] to learn more about {mobile-client}s in OpenShift and how to create them. 

== Binding your {mobile-client} to Services

Once you have created your {mobile-client}, it is possible to
bind it to other services in OpenShift. This will allow your applications to interact with services provisioned in your namespace. 

=== Getting started
To get started, click on your {mobile-client} from the overview screen, under the '{mobile-client}s' heading.
This will expand the {mobile-client} view, showing configuration details for your application and a section for managing bindings.

The bindings section displays a list of all possible services your {mobile-client} can be bound to. Bindings can be both created and deleted from this area. 

=== Creating bindings

A binding may be in one of 3 states at a single time: _not provisioned_, _available_ and _enabled_. 
These three states will be explained in further detail by binding an Android Application to Keycloak as an example.

==== Not provisioned

A binding is possible between the {mobile-client} and the service, but the service has not yet been provisioned in the namespace.

To create a new binding, simply click `provision Keycloak to enable binding`. This will allow you to provision the service as usual. In this case, Keycloak. 


==== Available

Once the service has been provisioned, it is now available to bind to your {mobile-client}.

To create a new binding, click  `bind Keycloak`. You will be prompted to bind your {mobile-client} to this service via a binding modal.

Enter the Client ID of your application, which can be found in the configuration details under `clientId`. In this case, `myapp-android` is the ID of the example Android application.

The client type dropdown allows you to choose the type of Keycloak client (bearer-only or public) that will be created for your application during the binding process. The `public` client option should be chosen for client bindings.
For more information about these two client types, see link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-core/blob/master/docs/walkthroughs/provision-keycloak-apb.adoc#client-types[here].

==== Enabled

A binding now exists between the {mobile-client} and the Keycloak service, and the `services` array in the configuration is automatically updated to reflect this association.

To delete the binding, simply click on the trash can icon next to the service name.
