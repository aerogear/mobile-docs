When provisioning a {keycloak-service} service, you are prompted to set the following configuration:

* *Keycloak admin username*: Username for Keycloak administration

* *Keycloak admin password*: Password for the Keycloak admin user

* *Name of the Keycloak realm*: Name of the keycloak realm. (defaults to current namespace)

NOTE: A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

* *Connect to an existing shared service*: Select if you want to use an existing service and you have the URL and credentials to use that service.

* *URL of the shared service*: Enter a value if you want to use an existing shared service.
