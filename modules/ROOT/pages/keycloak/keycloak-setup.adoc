== Keycloak Setup

The following guide helps you to configure schema of the redirect url and web origin for a client in Keycloak. This is required to use the Auth SDK.

=== Choose the schema of a redirect url

[role="primary"]
.Android
****
It is recommended to use the package name of the Android app as the schema of the redirect url to avoid conflicts. (e.g. `com.aerogear.androidshowcase`)
****
[role="secondary"]
.iOS
****
It is recommended to use the Bundle Identifier of the iOS app followed by `:/callback` as the schema of the redirect url. (e.g. `org.aerogear.ios-showcase-template:/callback`)
****
[role="secondary"]
.Cordova
****
The schema of the redirect url should be `\http://localhost/*`.
****

=== Configure Keycloak

. Open Keycloak Administration Console by selecting route in OpenShift.
. Open `Clients` from the menu.
. Open your Android client.
. Add the schema to `Valid Redirect URIs`.
. Add `*` to `Web Origins`.
