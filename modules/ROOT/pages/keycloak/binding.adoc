= Binding a {mobile-client} 

include::{partialsdir}/generic-binding.adoc[]
NOTE: Use `public` when binding a {mobile-client} to {service-name} Service, as it enables {mobile-client} to request tokens ({mobile-client} doesn't need to verify tokens). Use `bearer` when binding {service-name} Service to other services (If the other service to be bound does not need authentication.).

The {service-name} service will now be expandable, details about the service can be viewed.
