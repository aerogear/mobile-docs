. Choose the *Keycloak client type*. The default is `public` which allows the client to request tokens while type `bearer` should be used to bind to services that only need to verify tokens.
+
NOTE: The `public` client type should be used to bind to {mobile-client}s because they only need to request tokens, but not verify them. When binding to other services you should use client type `bearer` unless they also need to authenticate.
