= AeroGear Services Metrics documentation

This document explains how to use the AeroGear Metrics SDK on the IOS platform and integrate it with an App.

== Provided metrics

The default metrics contain App metrics, Device metrics and possibly other types in the future.
A Client ID and a timestamp are added to the top level of the Metrics object for categorization and visualization purposes. 
The Client ID will be generated and stored on the device when the App is started the first time.

=== App metrics

- *App ID*: The package name of your App
- *App version*: The version of your App
- *SDK version*: The version of the Aerogear SDK that is used
- *Framework*: Framework used for development (native)

=== Device metrics

- *Platform*: Hardcoded to `ios`
- *Platform Version*: Version of the platform (IOS10 etc.)
