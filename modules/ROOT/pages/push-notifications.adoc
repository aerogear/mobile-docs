= Using the {unifiedpush-service} Mobile Service
:page-partial:

[[introduction]]
The {unifiedpush-service} service allows you to send native push notifications to different mobile operating systems.

* Code once and push notifications to iOS and Android.
* Push notifications to defined groups.
* Push notifications to either iOS only or Android only.
* Push notifications to different variants of a mobile app.
* Push notifications from different back-end apps to the same mobile app.


Currently the service supports:

* link:https://developer.apple.com/notifications/[Apple Push Notification Service^]
* link:https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/[Firebase Cloud Messaging^]


The {unifiedpush-service} service offers a unified Notification Service API to the above mentioned Push Network Services.
It can be seen as a _broker_ that distributes push messages to different 3rd party Push Networks.

[NOTE]
====
* The payload of the push notification is delivered to 3rd party Push Network providers, Google or Apple. {org-name} recommends that users do not send any sensitive personal or confidential information (for example, a social security number, financial account or transactional information) as part of any Push Notification. Users of push notifications should not have an expectation of secure transmission.

* For analytic purposes, the service stores the content of the +alert+ key sent to the UnifiedPush Server.
The content of the +alert+ key belongs to the metadata, which is deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the UnifiedPush Server.

* You are only able to send push notifications to a real device, sending push notifications to an emulator fails.

* Push is a signalling mechanism and is not suitable to be used as a data carrying system, for example, a chat application.
