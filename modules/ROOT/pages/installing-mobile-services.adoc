= Setting up AeroGear {product-name} on OpenShift

To use {product-name}, you must run OpenShift and install an add-on which enables {product-name}. For more information about OpenShift, see https://www.openshift.org/.

NOTE: {org-name} recommends running OpenShift using the method described here. However there are many ways to run OpenShift, and {product-name} is compatible with most of these methods. There is a known issue with Minishift that makes it unsuitable for mobile development. This issue is described in link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/1287[].
