The support for an android data sync client is a wrapper for an apollo client. The apollo client is then used directly to https://graphql.org/learn/queries/[query] and https://moonhighway.com/understanding-graphql-mutations[mutate] your data against your custom API, as well as, create https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/android/subscriptions/2-apollo-subscription[subscriptions].  

Information about the apollo graphQL client for android can be found here: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/[appollo client for android].
