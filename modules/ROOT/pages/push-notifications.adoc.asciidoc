= Introduction to the {unifiedpush-service} Service

[[overview]]
== Overview



The {unifiedpush-service} service allows you to send native push notifications to different mobile operating systems.

* Code once and push notifications to iOS and Android
* Push notifications to defined groups
* Push notifications to either iOS only or Android only
* Push notifications to different variants of a mobile app
* Push notifications from different back-end apps to the same mobile app



Currently the service supports:


* link:https://developer.apple.com/notifications/[Apple Push Notification Service, window="_blank"]
* link:https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/[Firebase Cloud Messaging, window="_blank"]

[id='{context}_ref_terminology']

= {unifiedpush-service} Terminology

This section describes terminology that is associated with {unifiedpush-service}.

Push Application:: A logical construct that represents an Mobile App, for example, _Mobile HR_.

Push Notification Message:: A simple message to be sent to a Push Application.

Sender Endpoint API:: A RESTful API that receives Push Notification Message requests for a PushApplication or some of its different Variants. The Server translates this request into the platform specific details and delivers the payload to the 3rd party cloud providers, which eventually might deliver the message to the physical device.

Variant:: A variant of the Push Application, representing a specific mobile platform, like iOS or Android, or even more fine-grained differentiation like iPad or iPhone.
There can be multiple variants for a single Push Application (for example, _Mobile HR Android_, _Mobile HR iPad_, _Mobile HR iOS free_ or _Mobile HR iOS premium).
Each supported variant type contains some platform specific properties, such as a Google API key (Android) or passphrase and certificate (Apple).

APNs:: link:https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1[Apple Push Notification service].

Installation:: Represents an actual device, registered with the UnifiedPush Server. User1 running _HR Android_ app, while User2 runs _HR iPhone premium_ on his phone.

Administrative User Interface:: (AUI) The {push-ui} Web UI that allows you manage Push Applications and Variants, view statistics and send Push Notifications to devices.

:leveloffset!:

== Privacy note

As explained in the xref:how_the_unifiedpush_server_works[How the UnifiedPush Server works] section, the payload of the push notification is delivered to 3rd party Push Network providers, like Google or Apple.

WARNING: It is highly recommended to not send any sensitive personal or confidential information belonging to an individual (e.g. a social security number, financial account or transactional information, or any information where the individual may have a reasonable expectation of secure transmission) as part of any Push Notification.

For analytic purposes on our link:#_dashboard[Dashboard] we store the content of the +alert+ key sent to the UnifiedPush Server. The content of the +alert+ key belongs to the metadata, which is deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the UnifiedPush Server.

[[how_the_unifiedpush_server_works]]
== How the UnifiedPush Server Works

The {unifiedpush-service} service offers a unified Notification Service API to the above mentioned Push Network Services.
It can be seen as a _broker_ that distributes push messages to different 3rd party Push Networks.


NOTE: When using the UnifiedPush Server, please keep in mind that Push notification is a signalling mechanism and that it is not suitable to be used as a data carrying system (e.g. use in a chat application).

= Obtaining Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials

Before the Android application is able to receive the notifications, you must set up access to Firebase Cloud Messaging. As with iOS, you are only able to test out your push notifications in a real device. The following credentials are necessary to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for your app:

* the **Server key**
* the **Sender ID**
* the `google-services.json` file containing the credentials required to connect your app to Firebase and Google services.

. From the _Project Settings_ screen, switch to the _Cloud Messaging_ tab, where you can find the **Server key** and **Sender ID** (known in GCM as **Project Number**). There is also a _Legacy server key_ but it should not be used for new projects.

. Download the `google-services.json` file as described in the link:https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en[Google Documentation, window="_blank"].

= Enable Push Notifications for iOS App

The following guide helps you to enable Push Notifications for your iOS application.

. Follow the link:https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devdfd3d04a1[official Apple guide] to enable push notifications for your Xcode project.

. Follow  the link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide] to generate an APNs client TLS certificate and export the client TLS identity from your Mac.
+
NOTE: Make sure to protect the p12 file with a password.
+
NOTE: The exported p12 file with the password will be used later when binding your {mobile-client} to the {unifiedpush-service}.

= Provisioning {unifiedpush-service} Service

To provision the {service-name} mobile service:

. Log into the OpenShift console.
. Create a new project or choose an existing project.
. Select *Catalog* from the left hand menu.
+
You can filter the catalog items to only show mobile specific items by selecting the *Mobile* tab.
. Click *Services* and choose the {service-name} service.
+
image::catalog-mobile-services.png[]

. Follow the wizard for provisioning that service.
+
NOTE: If prompted to *Create a Binding*, choose *Do not bind at this time*.


Once the wizard steps are completed, navigate to the Project Overview in OpenShift to see the newly provisioned service.
Provisioning a service may take some time.

:service-name: Push Notifications

= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {service-name} service

== Prerequisites

[role="primary"]
.Android

****
* [x] A Google account
* [x] Access to the Firebase console. Refer to link:https://firebase.google.com/docs/[Firebase Docs].
****

[role="secondary"]
.iOS

****
* [x] An Apple Developer account
* [x] An APNs client TLS certificate. Refer to link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide].
****



To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in OpenShift using a {mobile-client}, and that {mobile-client} must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

== Procedure


. Navigate to the *Overview* of your OpenShift project.

. Select the {mobile-client} name listed in the {mobile-client}s section.

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.
+
image::mobile-clients-services-all-unbound.png[]

. Click *Create Binding* and follow the *Create Binding* wizard to associate the {mobile-client} with the {service-name} Service.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.

When you bind a mobile client to the {unifiedpush-service} service, a variant is created to store the credentials required to communicate with a push network.
Those credentials need to be provided in the binding dialog.

First pick your *Mobile Client Type*. Depending on the selection you then have to fill out the fields for either Android or iOS.

[role="primary"]
.Android

****
You need to provide a *Server Key* and a *Sender ID*. Both can be found in the Firebase console under *Project Settings > Cloud Messaging*. Make sure that you have selected `Android` in the `Mobile Client Type` dropdown.
****

[role="secondary"]
.iOS

****
You need an APNs client TLS certificate. Have a look at link:apple-setup.html[APNs Setup] for instructions on how to obtain one. Make sure that you have selected `iOS` in the `Mobile Client Type` dropdown.
The certificate needs to be encoded in base64 before copying it into the field labelled `iOS .p12 file`. If you're on Mac OS run:

----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64
----

If you're on Linux chances are that you're using a version of the base64 tool that does line wrapping. You need to disable this:

----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64 --wrap=0
----

****

After clicking Bind your variant will be created in UPS and you should see a new binding for your mobile client.
