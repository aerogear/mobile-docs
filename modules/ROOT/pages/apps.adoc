= Configuring my Mobile App to use Mobile Services

To use mobile services, you must include the following in your development environment:

* `mobile-services.json` file that you download from your {mobile-client} in the OpenShift console.
* the AeroGear SDK components appropriate for your application.

At a minimum, you must include the AeroGear SDK core component. See the documentation for each mobile service for details about any further requirements.
