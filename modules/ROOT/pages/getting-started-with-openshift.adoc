= Getting Started with OpenShift

After installing OpenShift with the mobile addon as described in xref:minishift_install.inc.adoc[Setting up AeroGear Mobile on Minishift] you can log into OpenShift using the credentials:

User: developer

Password: <any value if using Minishift>

A project is automatically created for you, and typically you use that project to provision and configure everything you need to use mobile services.

When you start OpenShift for the first time, the mobile addon may require some time to complete and mobile services might not appear in the service catalog for a few minutes. 

See the guide on how to xref:local_development.adoc[Set up a local installation of {org-name} {product-name}]
