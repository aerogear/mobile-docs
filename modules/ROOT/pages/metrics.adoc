= Using the {metrics-service} Mobile Service

[[introduction]]
The {metrics-service} service allows you to gather metrics on mobile apps, device versions, device security checks and back-end mobile service usage.

* Monitor usage by version of mobile app, platform and SDK
* Monitor interactions with the Identity Management service

Identity management is monitored by the Mobile Metrics Service when it is provisioned. No configuration is needed.

.Prerequisites

// TODO: need to rewrite the following
// * You are running OpenShift with {product-name} as described in xref:getting-started.adoc[Setting up AeroGear {product-name} on OpenShift].
* You have provisioned Mobile Developer Console as described in link:{installation-link}[Provisioning Mobile Developer Console].

// TODO: could we include this here in the assembly?
// * Read the xref:reference-material-{context}[{metrics-service} Service terminology].
