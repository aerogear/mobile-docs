= Binding the {sync-service} service to a Keycloak instance

This section will help you to bind a Keycloak service to the {sync-service} service.

== Prerequisites

* Ensure {sync-service} is xref:sync/provisioning.adoc[provisioned].
* Ensure {keycloak-service} is xref:keycloak/provisioning.adoc[provisioned]

== Creating the binding secret from a Keycloak instance

* Navigate to your Openshift project
* Select *Applications* and then *Provisioned Services*
* Select the *Identity Management* service from the list of Provisioned Services
* Select the *Create Binding* option
* Enter the *Service Instance Id* of the provisioned *{sync-service}* service

A secret will be created as a result of this binding.

== Making the secret available to the {sync-service} 

* Select *View Secret* on the *Identity Management* details page
* Select *Add to Application* and select the {sync-service} from the options
* Select the *Volume* option and enter the following mount path: `/opt/keycloak`

NOTE: The mount path must be set to `/opt/keycloak` for the {sync-service} to be configured to use the secret.
