= Adding Subscriptions to a Schema

GraphQL subscriptions allow you to be notified in realtime of changes to your data.
`Subscriptions` are defined in the Schema as their own type, just like with `Query` and `Mutation`:
```
type Query {
    notes: [Note]
}

type Mutation {
    addNote(text: String!)
}

type Subscription {
    noteAdded: Note
}
```

Learn more about Subscriptions and other operation types at link:https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name[GraphQL documentation]

== Publishing to a subscription

Subscriptions can be attached to `Mutations` only. 

Once defined in a Schema, you can assign them to any mutation's `Resolver` in the Resolvers tab. To do so, simply select any Resolver and choose one `Subscription` to publish to from the Subscriptions dropdown.
