= Adding {device-security-service} to your mobile app
:page-partial:

The Device Security service allows you to easily configure and manage device security, and trust checks for your mobile application.

* Perform a range of device trust checks on the mobile device, such as checking if the device is rooted, and allows you take proactive action based on the results.
* Distribute SSL certificates with a Mobile App to create a direct chain of trust (certificate pinning).

NOTE: Device Security is not currently associated with an OpenShift service, so there are no provisioning or binding tasks associated with using Device Security.

.Prerequisites

* You understand {device-security-service}.
* You have logged into the OpenShift console and the Mobile Developer Console.
* You are developing an Ionic app, plain Cordova is not supported.
