== Provisioning Mobile Services


Prerequisites:

* [x] You have installed Minishift with the mobilecore addon as described in xref:ROOT:minishift_install.inc.adoc[Setting Up].

TIP: If you have provisioned a {mobile-client}, you can navigate to that {mobile-client} and see what mobile services are available to provision.  

To provision a mobile service:

. Log into the OpenShift console.
. Click *Add to Project* and choose *Browse Catalog* from the options.
+
You can filter the catalog items to only show mobile specific items by clicking the *Mobile* tab.
. Click *Services* and choose the mobile service

. Follow the wizard for provisioning that service.

NOTE: If you have already registered a mobile app, you can also bind to that mobile app during the provisioning process. 

See the xref:services.adoc[list of all available services] and navigate to the documentation for the service you require.

After the service has been provisioned, you should then be able to see the service's secret and config map created during provision
within the project's resources.

To edit the service configuration, go to *Resources* -> *Config Maps* and select the service's config map.
Press the *[Actions]* button in the upper right corner and choose *[Edit]* or *[Edit YAML]*. This
allows you to edit the service's configuration directly which is then exposed to your mobile application.

== Deprovisioning
In order to delete a provisioned service, select the service menu and click *Delete*. A notification 
appears that the service has now been *Marked for Deletion*.
