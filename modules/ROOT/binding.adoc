= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {sync-service} server application service

To use {product-name}, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

.Procedure

. Launch {mobile-developer-console}

. Click on the {mobile-client} on the Overview screen

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
