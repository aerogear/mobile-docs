= Binding a Mobile App Record with Mobile Services

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in OpenShift using a {mobile-client} and that {mobile-client} must be associated with the mobile service.

TIP: The association between a {mobile-client} and a mobile service uses the xref:https://blog.openshift.com/asynchronous-bind-with-the-automation-broker/[OpenShift bind] feature.

To associate a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Navigate to the *Overview* your OpenShift project.

. Expand the {mobile-client} you want to associate by clicking the *>* icon.
+
NOTE: Your mobile app will be represented by two items in OpenShift, an item in the *{mobile-client}s* list and an item in the *Provisioned Services* list. Make sure to expand the item in the *{mobile-client}s* list.

. Note the value for `clientId` in the *Config Info* field. You will need this for the next step.

. Choose a mobile service from the *Integrations* list. If an option is not available, you can provision a service by choosing that option and associate the {mobile-client} later.

. Following the *Create Binding* wizard to associate the {mobile-client} with the mobile service. You may be prompted for a *{mobile-client} ID*. Enter the value you noted from the previous step.
