This document describes the functionality of a client SDK that works
with the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server.

[[motivation-purpose]]
Motivation / Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server[AeroGear
UnifiedPush Server] is accessible via HTTP. Instead of having to
manually register a device (`Installation`) with the HTTP interface, a
client library should be offered.

*Goal:* A client library to register a mobile application
(`Installation`) with the UnifiedPush Server.

[[background-push-network-token]]
Background: Push Network Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To receive native push notifications from a Push Network (e.g. APNs, GCM
or SimplePush), the mobile device is identified with a unique
`device-token`, assigned by the actual Push Network. This `device-token`
is passed, by the underlying Operating-System, to the mobile
application. Details are different on each platform and *not* part of
this document.

The `device-token` needs to be registered with the _AeroGear UnifiedPush
Server_, to indicate there is a new `Installation` for a `Variant`.

Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*WARNING:* _The focus of this specification is to describe the generic
minimum and not any platform-specific requirements_

The client SDK offers the following features:

* Registration and Updating of a `Installation`
* Unregistration of a `Installation` (optional, due to platform specific
restrictions)

[[registration-and-updating-of-a-installation]]
Registration and Updating of a Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everytime when a mobile application launches it receives the above
mentioned `device-token`, via a _platform-specific_ method (or
callback). Since the Push Network (e.g. APNs or GCM) _may_ assign a
*new* token to a device, it is _recommended_ to _always_ (re)register
the `device-token` with the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_.

The required metadata for an `Installation`:

* *deviceToken:* _Identifies the device/user-agent within its Push
Network._
* *variantID:* _The ID of the variant, where the client belongs to_
* *variantSecret:* _Password of the actual variant_

The _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ is able to store some user-specific
metadata as well:

* *deviceType:* _The device type of the device or the user agent._
* *operatingSystem:* _The name of the underlying Operating System._
* *osVersion:* _The version of the used Operating System._
* *alias:* _Application specific alias to identify users with the
system. For instance an `email address` or a `username`._
* *categories:* _Used to apply one or more "tags"._
* *simplePushEndpoint:* _SimplePush specific Endpoint URL, which is used
to send updates to the SimplePush server._

[[reachability]]
Reachability
++++++++++++

Internally, the client SDK needs to check if the device can establish a
connection to the internet (PushNetwork and UnifiedPush Server). It
should make use of the platform-specific APIs to check the reachability
of the services.

[[unregistration-of-client-device-information]]
Unregistration of client device information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

_Optional_ method that helps to unregister the client device information
with the Unified Push Server.

*Note:* The method is optional, since not all supported Push Networks
recommend having a client application actively performing an
_unregister_. Apple for instance has a `Feedback Service`, which the
_AeroGear Unified Push Server_ needs to frequently query for inactive
tokens. Tokens, with Apple, are _inactive_ when the user:

* Disables Push (Settings)
* Deinstalls the app

[[platform-specific-details]]
Platform specific details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every client platform has its own base APIs, to receive Push Message
from its Push Network. The AeroGear client SDK _may_ offer utilities to
simplify this process even more. _For example: In Android a custom
`Intent` is required, therefore it would make sense if the "AeroGear
Android Push Client Library" offers a convenience implementation for
this class._
