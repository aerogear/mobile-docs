*Note*

Metrics service and Keycloak service must be provisioned within the same namespace,
otherwise the Keycloak's metrics endpoint won't be reachable for Prometheus and no data will be displayed.

== Overview

After the Metrics service (includes Grafana tool and Prometheus monitoring system) and Keycloak service are provisioned, 
you should be able to see the "Keycloak Metrics" in the list of available dashboards 
(navigate to Grafana's exposed URL -> Log in -> Home -> Select *Keycloak Metrics*)
