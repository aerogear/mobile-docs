. In order to perform SSO, you need to make sure there is at least one client configured in Keycloak. Ensure the Keycloak client has the following settings:

.. *Client ID* is the client identifier for OIDC requests. This should be a simple alpha-numeric string. You can change this to the name of your app.
.. *Enabled* should be set to *ON*.
.. The *openid-connect* option should be selected in the *Client Protocol* drop down box.
.. For this example, the *public* option can be selected in the *Access Type* drop down box.
.. *Standard Flow Enabled* should be set to *ON*.
.. *Valid Redirect URIs* should contain the redirect URL that has been specified in your mobile application.

. You can use the same Keycloak client in another mobile app to achieve SSO. All you have to do is to add the redirect url of app to "Valid Redirect URIs" sections. 

. Alternatively, you can also create a new client for another mobile app. Please follow this Keycloak guide - link:http://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#oidc-clients[Keycloak OIDC Clients] and ensure your client has the configuration specified in step 1.

. Finally, create a user inside the Realm by navigating to *Users* on the left hand side.  Click add user and fill in the user details.  On clicking save, ensure to navigate to the *Credentials* tab of the new user and give them a password.  You'll be prompted to change this password on first login.
