= Using Antora to convert asciidoc to html

After modifying documentation, you can validate your changes and preview the results by:

. Install Antora globally as described in their https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/install-antora/[install guide].
. Change to the `docs` directory of the repo you want to convert. For some repos, eg `mobile-docs` and `processes`, use the root directory of the repo. 
. Install the `site-generator`:
+
----
npm i @antora/site-generator-default
----
+
NOTE: As part of Antora installation, you should have already installed site-generator globally.

. Modify the site definition as required. If you are working on a branch, you'll want to specify that branch in the `local-site.yml` file. For example:
+
----
site:
  title: AeroGear
  url: https://www.aerogear.org
  start_page: processes::index
content:
  sources:
  - url: .
    branches: AEROGEAR-2480
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    experimental: ''
    idprefix: ''
    idseparator: '-'
    linkattrs: ''
    mobile-next: 'AeroGear Mobile Services'
    mobile-client: '{mobile-client} '
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/finp/antora-ui/raw/master/build/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true

----

. Run antora:
+
----
antora local-site.yml
