= AeroGear Processes for Documentation

== Overview 

The AeroGear documentation is written in asciidoc and located in github code repos. The two github organizations where docs are located are:

* link:https://github.com/aerogearcatalog[aerogearcatalog] - each mobile service is represented by a code repo, and the docs for that service are in the `docs` directory.

* link:https://github.com/aerogear[aerogear] - each mobile sdk is represented by a code repo, and the docs for that sdk are in the `docs` directory. This organization also includes the `mobile-docs` and `processes` repo that is exclusively documentation and is generic to all services and sdks.

The main controller for publishing is located in https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-docs
